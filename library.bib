abstract = {During the last decade there has been considerable debate over the relatively vague concept of the “smart city”. Nowadays, the smart city has crystallised into an image of a city permeated with top-down and centrally controlled technological infrastructures that promise to improve the urban environment in terms of efficiency, security and sustainability. However, many scholars have criticised this perception of networked technologies for not being able to meet the needs of city-dwellers, raising privacy issues, and leading to an increase of environmentally harmful consumption of ICTs. The aim of this article is to contribute to the ongoing dialogue by providing a taxonomy of the smart city, based on certain technology governance models. After theoretically discussing the socio-environmental costs of each model, I argue for a commons-oriented approach which could democratise the means of making and offer more environmental benefits.},

@article{Kitchenham2009,
abstract = {Background: In 2004 the concept of evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) was introduced at the ICSE04 conference. Aims: This study assesses the impact of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) which are the recommended EBSE method for aggregating evidence. Method: We used the standard systematic literature review method employing a manual search of 10 journals and 4 conference proceedings. Results: Of 20 relevant studies, eight addressed research trends rather than technique evaluation. Seven SLRs addressed cost estimation. The quality of SLRs was fair with only three scoring less than 2 out of 4. Conclusions: Currently, the topic areas covered by SLRs are limited. European researchers, particularly those at the Simula Laboratory appear to be the leading exponents of systematic literature reviews. The series of cost estimation SLRs demonstrate the potential value of EBSE for synthesising evidence and making it available to practitioners. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In this work we describe the synthesis, thermal and rheological characterization, hot-melt extrusion, and three-dimensional printing (3DP) of poly(2-vinylpyridine) (P2VP). We investigate the effect of thermal processing conditions on physical properties of produced filaments in order to achieve high quality, 3D-printable filaments for material extrusion 3DP (ME3DP). Mechanical properties and processing performances of P2VP were enhanced by addition of 12 wt {\%} acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS), which reinforced P2VP fibers. We 3D-print P2VP filaments using an affordable 3D printer. The pyridine moieties are cross-linked and quaternized postprinting to form 3D-printed pH-responsive hydrogels. The printed objects exhibited dynamic and reversible pH-dependent swelling. These hydrogels act as flow-regulating valves, controlling the flow rate with pH. Additionally, a macroporous P2VP membrane was 3D-printed and the coordinating ability of the pyridyl groups was employed to immobilize silver precursors on it...},

abstract = {Traditional assembly line manufacturing is speculative, costly and environmentally unsustainable. It is speculative because it commits substantial resources - energy, materials, shipping, handling, stocking and displaying - without a guaranteed sale. It is costly because each of these resources - material, process, people and place - involves expense not encountered when a product is manufactured at the time of sale. It is environmentally unsustainable because, no matter how much recycling is done, not using the resources unless actually needed is always a better path. Three-dimensional printing is currently of great commercial interest as it can be employed to manufacture parts on-demand economically and without the significant cost {\&} environmental downsides, i.e. inventory and waste, associated with traditional manufacturing processes. Herein, we describe the formulation of a novel water-based material which can be used in a traditional 3D printer extrusion process to create optically transparent glass-based objects. Such objects have a wide range of applications including, but not wholly limited to: security printing using color {\&} coating effects, protective films and coatings, electronic codes readable by smartphones, tablets or touch screens. Additional all glass objects traditionally manufactured by the so called kiln glass method can be generated by this type of 3D printing making it interesting for the high end market of art objects. {\textcopyright} 2013 Materials Research Society.},

abstract = {Objectives: To compare traditional plaster casts, digital models and 3D printed copies of dental plaster casts based on various criteria. To determine whether 3D printed copies obtained using open source system RepRap can replace traditional plaster casts in dental practice. To compare and contrast the qualities of two possible 3D printing options - open source system RepRap and commercially available 3D printing.Design and settings: A method comparison study on 10 dental plaster casts from the Orthodontic department, Department of Stomatology, 2nd medical Faulty, Charles University Prague, Czech Republic.Material and methods: Each of 10 plaster casts were scanned by inEos Blue scanner and the printed on 3D printer RepRap [10 models] and ProJet HD3000 3D printer [1 model]. Linear measurements between selected points on the dental arches of upper and lower jaws on plaster casts and its 3D copy were recorded and statistically analyzed.Results: 3D printed copies have many advantages over traditional plaster casts. The precision and accuracy of the RepRap 3D printed copies of plaster casts were confirmed based on the statistical analysis. Although the commercially available 3D printing enables to print more details than the RepRap system, it is expensive and for the purpose of clinical use can be replaced by the cheaper prints obtained from RepRap printed copies.Conclusions: Scanning of the traditional plaster casts to obtain a digital model offers a pragmatic approach. The scans can subsequently be used as a template to print the plaster casts as required. Using 3D printers can replace traditional plaster casts primarily due to their accuracy and price. {\textcopyright} 2013 Kasparova et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

@article{Lewis2005a,
abstract = {Organizational ‘innovation laboratories', dedicated facilities for encouraging creative behaviours and supporting innovative projects, have received scant academic attention despite their increasing popularity with a range of different practitioners. This paper develops an initial theoretical explanation of the phenomenon, based upon notions of organizational learning and dynamic capabilities. This framework is then used as the basis for analysing the structure, infrastructure, benefits and dis-benefits of three UK-based laboratory facilities (mass service, government department, academic institution). Preliminary conclusions suggest that the ‘innovation laboratory' can offer real benefits for organizations: reinforcing corporate commitment to innovation and creativity by providing a physical manifestation of dynamic capability and double-loop learning concepts. Although the physical design of the space is central to its functionality – emphasizing dislocation from day-to-day activity, eliminating hierarchy, encouraging participation – direct facilitation remains critical to successful operation. There are also dis-benefits associated with what can be substantial financial investments and there is some evidence that such facilities can have a relatively short useful lifespan. Given the limited nature of the empirical base, the paper concludes with some specific suggestions for further work.},

abstract = {Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is one of the most widely used additive manufacturing processes for fabricating prototypes and functional parts in common engineering plastics. The process is based on the extrusion of heated feedstock plastic filaments through a nozzle tip to deposit layers onto a platform to build parts layer by layer directly from a digital model of the part. The simplicity, reliability, and affordability of the FDM process have made the additive manufacturing technology widely recognized and adopted by industry, academia, and consumers. The FDM process has also been widely used by research and development sectors to improve the process, develop new materials, and apply the FDM systems in a wide range of engineering applications.

This introduces artistic capabilities to fine dining, and extend customization capabilities to industrial culinary sector. The selected prototypes are reviewed based on fabrication platforms and printing materials. A detailed discussion on specific 3DP technologies and their associate dispensing/printing process for 3D customized food fabrication are reported for single and multi-material applications. Eventually, impacts of food printing on personalized nutrition, on-demand food fabrication, food processing technologies and process design are reported. Their applications in domestic cooking or catering services can not only provide an engineering solution for customized food design and personalized nutrition control, but also a potential machine to reconfigure a customized food supply chain.},

abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) produces three dimensional objects directly from a digital model by the successive addition of material(s), without the use of a specialized tooling. AM allows the rapid development of sustainable products and has been increasingly used to produce lightweight components to save materials and costs. This particularly helps to save a considerable amount of material, energy and cost for the production of one-off or small volume products. In addition, the non-processed raw materials can be recycled and re-used by AM to reduce material waste drastically. AM is therefore considered as a sustainable manufacturing approach driving the rapid development of new products. The paper will present and review the research activities performed in the University of Exeter to enhance the sustainability of AM. These research activities include: 1) sustainable product design by optimising internal lightweight structures; 2) improvement of process efficiency by optimising AM process parameters; 3) reduction of energy consumption by in situ thermite material reaction; 4) sustainable production of personalised chocolates.},

abstract = {Polymers are the most versatile material in our modern day and age. With certain chemicals and additives (pigments, concentrates, anti-blockers, light transformers (LTs), UV-stabilizers, etc.), they become what we know as plastics. The aim of this review is to provide the reader with an in depth analysis regarding the recovery, treatment and recycling routes of plastic solid waste (PSW), as well as the main advantages and disadvantages associated with every route. Recovery and recycling of PSW can be categorized by four main routes, i.e. re-extrusion, mechanical, chemical and energy recovery. Re-extrusion (primary recycling) utilizes scrap plastics by re-introducing the reminder of certain extruded thermoplastics (mainly poly-??-olefins) into heat cycles within a processing line. When plastic articles are discarded after a number of life cycles, mechanical recycling techniques present themselves as a candidate for utilizing a percentage of the waste as recyclate and/or fillers. Collectively, all technologies that convert polymers to either monomers (monomer recycling) or petrochemicals (feedstock recycling) are referred to as chemical recycling. The technology behind its success is the depolymerization processes (e.g. thermolysis) that can result in a very profitable and sustainable industrial scheme, providing a high product yield and a minimal waste. Nevertheless, due to their high calorific value and embodied energy, plastics are being incinerated solely or in combination with municipal solid waste (MSW) in many developed countries. This review also presents a number of application and technologies currently being used to incinerate plastics. Cement kilns and fluidized beds are the two most common units used to recover energy from PSW or MSW with high PSW content. It is concluded that, tertiary (chemical methods) and quaternary (energy recovery) are robust enough to be investigated and researched in the near future, for they provide a very sustainable solution to the PSW cycle. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recently, interest in composite manufacturing has shifted towards the use of natural fibres as reinforcement because of their environmental benefits. The use of a biodegradable matrix is worth considering since this would result in a completely biodegradable composite. In order to assess the most suitable matrix polymer, one must know the properties of the available polymers. Since data tend to be widely scattered over many sources and are very scarce compared to the conventional polymers, it is the purpose of this article to give an overview of the most relevant properties of a range of biodegradable polymers. An overview such as the one given here may provide a useful guide in establishing the best compromise between conflicting property demands. Data are presented mostly as ranges (in tables) as well as in graphs for quick comparison reasons. One specific application (thermoplastic pultrusion with flax as reinforcement) is also studied. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The tensile strength, failure strain, Poisson's ratio, coefficient of thermal expansion and modulus were all shown to vary significantly depending on the build orientation of identical dogbones. FDM parts ranged in strength from 46 to 85{\%} of strengths attainable from comparable injection-molded parts. The coefficient of variation (CV) increased from 2 to 13{\%} as the primary layer orientation deviated from the primary load direction. CAT scan and SEM were employed to relate the corresponding macrostructure to the mechanical response of the material along the parts??? 3-primary directions, using digital image correlation (DIC). The fracture surfaces of these parts further suggest that 3D FDM materials behave more like laminated composite structures than isotropic cast resins and therefore design allowables should reflect actual part build configurations.},

abstract = {The process of developing a new technology through open discussion has been called collective invention.  This paper documents two episodes of collective invention and proposes a general model based on search theory. The first episode deals with the development of mass production steel in the U.S. (1866-1885), and the second with early personal computers (1975-1985).  In both cases technical people openly discussed and sometimes shared technology they were developing.  Both technologies advanced to the point that they supported substantial economic growth.  Open source software development is partway through a similar process now. The episodes have common features.  The process begins with an invention or a change in legal restrictions.  Hobbyists and startup firms experiment with practical methods of production and share their results through a social network.  The members of the network form a new industry or change an existing one.  The network then disappears if the new firms keep their research and development secret.  A model of the search for innovations can describe this process if it is expanded to include independent hobbyists and consultants as well as profit-seeking firms.},

abstract = {In the future, long-established paradigms of production will still have to continue to change in order to meet the demand for even more individuality, customer-specific product variants and shortest delivery times within the meaning of the term “production on demand”. Therefore, in the future, the concept of the Distributed Manufacturing by geographically distributed production systems plays an increasingly important role. New and innovative ways of organizing production operations will be needed. Particularly due to the increasingly loud request for a sustainable and ecologically production and distribution decentralized manufacturing systems are an ideal approach, because the production takes place closer to the customer. It needs modern organizational models for small, flexible and scalable production units in decentralized production networks, which take into account the local and individual customer needs and produce as possible locally. This paper presents the drivers for the trend towards decentralized and distributed manufacturing systems. In addition, the paper gives a complete overview of traditional and modern forms of geographically distributed production and the prospect of new and partly visionary development directions. The paper examines the range of the concept of Distributed Manufacturing starting from standardized factories to visionary generative manufacturing units according the concept of Cloud-Production.},

abstract = {Fabrication spaces (Fab-spaces) provide individuals with access to numerous manufacturing equipment (including additive manufacturing), to carry out different types of projects. Although scholars are starting to speculate about the importance of these new organisational forms and their potential for future distributed innovation and production ecologies, this phenomenon is still largely unexplored. Building on existing multidisciplinary research, this paper offers the first empirical analysis of existing fab-spaces as providers of knowledge and production competencies. Amongst all the possible perspectives to derive a framework, we choose that of fab-space users who have an entrepreneurial intention. After deriving an analytical framework to position fab-spaces in the current academic discourse, the paper develops a classification, which considers the competences available to entrepreneurs, via fab-spaces, in conjunction with how these competences are provided. The resulting map reveals the complementarities amongst the different fab-spaces. It also shows that the current portfolio of fab-spaces supports mainly the distribution of innovation across locations and social groups. Several types of fab-spaces are currently well placed to support the transition from innovation to manufacturing, but their geographical distribution and range of manufacturing capabilities are not yet enough to provide a fully distributed manufacturing model. This study has practical consequences for entrepreneurs, in the better identification of the appropriate fab-spaces for their needs, and for policy-makers, to help position the different types of fab-spaces as elements for national systems of innovation and production.},

abstract = {Abstract Humankind's next step into space will require long-term habitation and shelter on the lunar surface, which will only be possible if pressurized habitats are available. Buildings on Earth are designed to take advantage of the superior compressive properties of the building material. On the other hand, this luxury will not be available on the Moon because the internal pressure in the building will result in the entire structure being under tension. The use of in situ fabricated glass-fiber composite and the recently developing rapid-prototyping type technology will be useful in fabricating pressurized lunar habitats. Hence, the main objective of the designer will be to reduce the tensile stresses and bring them to manageable limits. This work is concerned with the study of design changes that will result in efficient habitats on the Moon. Designs are presented in this paper that would tend to reduce the tensile stresses and increase the compressive stresses, making it possible to build habitats that will be practical and safe. Proper design and appropriate materials would be the key to building the habitats on the lunar surface. Some ideas for the recycling of carrier moduli have also been presented to reduce possible junk on the lunar surface. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {The growth of desktop 3-D printers is driving an interest in recycled 3-D printer filament to reduce costs of distributed production. Life cycle analysis studies were performed on the recycling of high density polyethylene into filament suitable for additive layer manufacturing with 3-D printers. The conventional centralized recycling system for high population density and low population density rural locations was compared to the proposed in home, distributed recycling system. This system would involve shredding and then producing filament with an open-source plastic extruder from post-consumer plastics and then printing the extruded filament into usable, value-added parts and products with 3-D printers such as the open-source self replicating rapid prototyper, or RepRap. The embodied energy and carbon dioxide emissions were calculated for high density polyethylene recycling using SimaPro 7.2 and the database EcoInvent v2.0. The results showed that distributed recycling uses less embodied energy than the best- case scenario used for centralized recycling. For centralized recycling in a low-density population case study involving substantial embodied energy use for transportation and collection these savings for distributed recycling were found to extend to over 80{\%}. If the distributed process is applied to the U.S. high density polyethylene currently recycled, more than 100 million MJ of energy could be conserved per annum along with the concomitant significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. It is concluded that with the open-source 3-D printing network expanding rapidly the potential for widespread adop- tion of in-home recycling of post-consumer plastic represents a novel path to a future of distributed manufacturing appropriate for both the developed and developing world with lower environmental impacts than the current system},

Distributed recycling of post-consumer HDPE for 3D printing filament uses less embodied energy (Reduction up to 80{\%} in transportation and collection) than the best-case scenario investigated for a high-population density using centralized recycling.},

abstract = {The widespread use of plastics in the conditioning, packaging and building material sectors generates an enormous amount of industrial waste which could be recycled for wastewater pipes and fittings. Nevertheless, current manufacturing standards in the piping industry recommend against the use of post-consumer recycled materials - a policy based on inadequate understanding of the properties and long-term mechanical performance of recycled materials. The present study compared the material characteristics of virgin and recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastics commonly found in the piping industry. Mechanical testing, oxidative induction time (OIT), melt flow index (MFI) and thermal analysis were used in conjunction with X-ray fluorescence (??-XRF), size exclusion chromatography and {\textless}sup{\textgreater}13{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}C solid-state NMR to evaluate mechanical behavior and molecular structure as well as contaminant or filler contents. This study provides evidence for the degradation processes impact that can occur when post-industrial and post-consumer polymers are recycled. However, the study identified two measures to improve the material qualities of post-consumer recycled HDPE: 1) reducing the amount of contaminants or, alternatively, improving their compatibility with HDPE resins, and 2) improving current sorting and recycling processes to increase the amount of tie molecules in HDPE materials.},

Samples were analysed for changes in mechanical, rheological and chemical properties. Data obtained in this study, by means of tensile, impact, and melt flow tests, GPC, gloss and colour analyses showed that the effect of UV exposure, whether in the field or artificial environments, was not significant as far as the mechanical properties of the materials were concerned. There was some change in the surface characteristics but such surface effects would not compromise the mechanical integrity of the product when recycled. During reprocessing of the materials, it is likely that stabilizer is redistributed at the surface of any new moulding, thus renewing the surface characteristics. Hence damaged or end-of-life products need not be discounted from recycling. ?? 2006.},

To ensure the development of additive manufacturing processes it seems important to develop the concept of DFSAM (Design for Sustainable Additive Manufacturing). In fact, one of the objectives of environmental sustainable manufacturing is to minimize the whole flux consumption (electricity, material and fluids) during manufacturing step. To achieve this goal, it is interesting to get a predictive model of consumptions, integrated in the design step, allowing to evaluate the product's environmental impact during the manufacturing step. This paper presents a new methodology for electric, fluids and raw material consumptions assessment for additive manufacturing processes, in particular for a direct metal deposition process. The methodology will help engineers to design parts optimized for additive manufacturing with an environmental point of view.},

abstract = {To facilitate optimal application of appropriate scaffold architectures for clinical trials, there is a need to compare different scaffold modifications under similar experimental conditions. In this study was assessed the effectiveness of poly-e-caprolactone (PCL) scaffolds fabricated by fused deposition modelling (FDM), with varying material modifications, for the purposes of bone tissue engineering. The incorporation of hydroxyapatite (HA) in PCL scaffolds, as well as precalcification through immersion in a simulated body fluid (SBF) to produce a biomimetic apatite coating on the scaffolds, was assessed. A series of in vitro studies spanning 3 weeks as well as in vivo studies utilizing a subcutaneous nude mouse model were carried out. PCL and HA-PCL scaffolds demonstrated increasing tissue growth extending throughout the implants, as well as superior mechanical strength and mineralization, as evidenced by X-ray imaging after 14 weeks in vivo. No significant difference was found between PCL and HA-PCL scaffolds. Precalcification with SBF did not result in increased osteoconductivity and cell proliferation as previously reported. Conversely, tensile forces exerted by tissue sheets bridging adjacent struts of the PCL scaffold caused flaking of the apatite coating that resulted in impaired cell attachment, growth and mineralization. The results suggest that scaffolds fabricated by FDM may have load-bearing applications.},

Different ratios of micro-ground macadamia nutshells and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastics were mixed with a binding agent to extrude a range of filaments. By using a commercial 3D printer, these filaments helped to fabricate specimens that were tested in tension and compression. The results show that printed samples of macadamia-nutshell�{\_}"ABS composites offer a viable alternative to commercially available wood polymer composite filaments. Although they possess similar mechanical properties, they have a lower density, making them suitable for a range of lightweight product applications. The research demonstrates that there are new opportunities for the use of macadamia nutshell filament in additive manufacturing as a result of its enhanced properties compared with traditional wood filaments},

abstract = {In this research, the effect of reprocessing of acrylonitrile-butadiene- styrene (ABS) on the mechanical properties of the polymer was studied through a five-stage reprocessing. To this end, the injection mold of the standard samples was manufactured. Then, using an injection molding machine, all of the virgin material was processed. After sampling, the rest of the parts were ground and then reprocessed under the same conditions. In order to get a proper combinational ratio of virgin and recycled ABS with respect to shrinkage and mechanical properties, another experiment was designed. In order to do this, virgin material was blended with 20{\%}, 35{\%} and 50{\%} of the recycled material. The blends were reprocessed and samples were obtained. Impact, tensile, flexural and shrinkage tests, selected from ASTM standard, were used to investigate the mechanical properties of the polymer as well as its shrinkage. Furthermore, viscosity test was used to investigate the changes in the structure of the polymer. As the reprocessing cycles increased, shrinkage decreased and tensile and flexural ultimate strengths increased, more in flexural strength than in tensile. While Young's modulus slightly increased, viscosity decreased and consequently molecular weight decreased too. The proper blend for the least shrinkage was 50{\%} whereas the best mechanical properties were achievable by the 20{\%} blend. The obtained results suggest that reprocessing causes polymer degradation which is a result of the break in the bonds of poly butadiene. Moreover, it can be concluded that reprocessing in ABS can lead to the loss of effectiveness of some additives. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The consequences of adopting this novel production technology on industrial sustainability are not well understood and this exploratory study draws on publically available data to provide insights into the impacts of additive manufacturing on sustainability. Benefits are found to exist across the product and material life cycles through product and process redesign, improvements to material input processing, make-to-order component and product manufacturing, and closing the loop. As an immature technology, there are substantial challenges to these benefits being realised at each stage of the life cycle.

abstract = {3D Printing technologies have received extensive attention in recent years, but empirical investigations of how this technology is used for manufacturing are still sparse. More knowledge is also needed regarding how 3D Printing affects the competitive dynamics between firms. This article explores how 3D Printing has been adopted for manufacturing and discusses under what conditions it might influence competition in different industries. Drawing upon data from the global hearing aid industry's adoption of 3D Printing during the period 1989-2008, this paper describes some of the benefits of using the technology, while also pointing out challenges firms encounter in making this transition. The study shows that early adopters were exposed to more technological uncertainty related to choosing printers. All firms encountered operational challenges as 3D Printing required new skill sets, but the technology had little impact on the competitive dynamics of this industry. Drawing upon literature on technological discontinuities, platforms and ecosystems, the paper illustrates and explains why the technology was not disruptive and also discusses how these findings apply to other industrieswhere 3D Printing is currently gaining momentum.},

Initially, melt flow index (MFI) test confirms the qualification of this material, as an alternative material for the fabrication of FDM filament. The differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements characterize the material by recording their phase and mass changes as a function of temperature. The DSC results confirmed the decrease of crystallinity with the inclusion of nano fillers but also realized that these filler particles act as a thermodynamic sink and improves its stability. The TGA analysis also demonstrated the increase in thermal stability and flame retardancy level of NC material. In addition to above scanning electron microscopy analysis visualized the dispersion of filler materials in Nylon 6 matrix.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) techniques1 can produce complex, high-value metal parts, with potential applications as critical parts, such as those found in aerospace components. The production of AM parts with consistent and predictable properties requires input materials (e.g., metal powders) with known and repeatable characteristics, which in turn requires standardized measurement methods for powder properties. First, based on our previous work, we assess the applicability of current standardized methods for powder characterization for metal AM powders. Then we present the results of systematic studies carried out on two different powder materials used for additive manufacturing: stainless steel and cobalt-chrome. The characterization of these powders is important in NIST efforts to develop appropriate measurements and standards for additive materials and to document the property of powders used in a NIST-led additive manufacturing material round robin. An extensive array of characterization techniques was applied to these two powders, in both virgin and recycled states. The physical techniques included laser diffraction particle size analysis, X-ray computed tomography for size and shape analysis, and optical and scanning electron microscopy. Techniques sensitive to structure and chemistry, including X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive analytical X-ray analysis using the X-rays generated during scanning electron microscopy, and X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy were also employed. The results of these analyses show how virgin powder changes after being exposed to and recycled from one or more Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) additive manufacturing build cycles. In addition, these findings can give insight into the actual additive manufacturing process.},

The paper is the result of a collaborative process among several open innovation scholars—having a common basis in the recurrent Professional Development Workshop (PDW) on “Researching Open Innovation” at the Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management. In this paper, we present opportunities for future research on open innovation, organized at different levels of analysis. We discuss some of the contingencies at these different levels, and argue that future research needs to study open innovation— originally an organizational-level phenomenon—across multiple levels of analysis. While our integrative framework allows comparing, contrasting, and integrating different perspectives at different levels of analysis, further theorizing will be needed to advance open innovation research. On this basis, we propose some new research categories as well as questions for future research— particularly those that span across research domains that have so far developed in isolation.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe the ageing behaviour of acrylate-based resins for stereolithography (SL) technology using different test methods and to investigate these effects on polymers. Design/methodology/ approach - Controlling the polymer degradation requires an understanding of many different phenomena, including the different chemical mechanisms underlying structural changes in polymer macromolecules, the influences of polymer morphology, the complexities of oxidation chemistry and the complex reaction pathways of polymer additives. Several ageing characterization experiments are given. Findings - The paper covers the ageing process analysis of acrylate-based polymers. An overview of the ageing behaviour is given, along with the bandwidth of material characteristics for a prolonged lifetime of this material class. Research limitations/implications - For research and development in the field of rapid prototyping (RP) materials data about ageing behaviour and environmental effects are crucial. The authors show possible methods for measuring these effects and discuss the consequences in material research using a recently developed biocompatible SL resin as an example. Practical implications - The study of the ageing behaviour of polymers is important for understanding their usability, storage, lifetime and recycling. The presented polymeric formulations are able to meet the growing demand for both soft and stiff manufacturing resin materials in the engineering and medical fields. Originality/value - The analysis of the ageing behaviour of polymer materials is an important issue for engineering applications, recycling of post-consumer plastic waste, as well as the use of polymers as biological implants and matrices for drug delivery and the lifetime of an article. The paper gives an overview of details involving ageing behaviour and their meaning for applications of acrylate-based SL resins and is therefore of high importance to people with interest in long-term behaviour and ageing of RP materials},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing with 3-D printers may be a key technology enabler for entrepreneurs seeking to use disruptive innovations such as business models utilizing distributed manufacturing. Unlike centralized manufacturing, distributed manufacturing makes the parts and products (the prints) at (or closer to) the source of the demand, cutting out much of the traditional supply chain. Although many expect 3-D printing to take off at the household level and previous work has shown significant returns for those choosing to do so, there are still significant barriers to entry for typical consumers. Our analysis demonstrates that for an individual to make an abnormally high return on their investments in 3-D printers, they must serve others to achieve high utilization rates. The impetus to do so is created by a service that can undercut traditionally manufactured products due to affordability and customizability. Low-cost, open-source 3-D printers are now priced within range of individual entrepreneurs who can take advantage of the long tail of consumers with highly varied interests. The margin advantage, net present value, and return on investment (ROI) analysis provided herein could form the basis of thousands of new small-business ventures in the coming years. {\textcopyright} 2015 Springer-Verlag London},

abstract = {Various analytical techniques (thermal analysis, vibrational spectroscopy, and chromatographic analysis) were used in order to monitor the changes in polymeric properties of recycled high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) throughout mechanical recycling processes. Three key quality properties were defined and analysed; these were the degree of mixing (composition), the degree of degradation, and the presence of low molecular weight compounds. Polymeric contaminations of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) were detected in some samples using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Vibrational spectroscopy showed the presence of oxidised parts of the polymeric chain and gave also an assessment of the microstructure of the polybutadiene phase in HIPS. The presence of low molecular weight compounds in the HIPS samples was demonstrated using microwave-assisted extraction followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Several volatile organic compounds (VOCs), residues from the polymerisation, additives, and contaminations were detected in the polymeric materials. Styrene was identified already in virgin HIPS; in addition, benzaldehyde, $\alpha$-methylbenzenaldehyde, and acetophenone were detected in recycled HIPS. The presence of oxygenated derivates of styrene may be attributed to the oxidation of polystyrene (PS). Several styrene dimers were found in virgin and recycled HIPS; these are produced during polymerisation of styrene and retained in the polymeric matrix as polymerisation residues. The amount of these dimers was highest in virgin HIPS, which indicated that emission of these compounds may have occurred during the first life-time of the products. This paper demonstrates that a combination of different analytical strategies is necessary to obtain a detailed understanding of the quality of recycled HIPS. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In this report we demonstrate how to fabricate soft prostheses mold with a low cost desktop 3D printer. The fabrication method used is referred to as Scanning Printing Polishing Casting (SPPC). Firstly the anatomy is scanned with a 3Dscanner, then a tissue casting mold is designed on computer and printed with a desktop 3D printer. Subsequently, a chemical polishing method is used to polish the casting mold by removing the staircase effect and acquiring a smooth surface. Finally, the last step is to cast medical grade silicone into the mold. After the silicone is cured, the fine soft prostheses can be removed from the mold. Utilizing the SPPC method, soft prostheses with smooth surface and complicated structure can be fabricated at a low cost. Accordingly, the total cost of fabricating ear prosthesis is about {\$}30, which is much lower than the current soft prostheses fabrication methods},

Using a literature review, interviews, and benchmarking data, the paper examines the relationship between physical environment and innovation. Findings – The findings from both the literature review and the interviews underline innovation as a communicative and human-centred process. As a result five attributes of innovative space are presented: collaboration enabling, modifiability, smartness, attractiveness, and value reflecting.

As AM has matured, specific classes of material have become associated with specific AM processes and applications. This paper gathers this information for each of the seven categories of ISO/ASTM AM categories. Polymers, metals, ceramics and composites are considered. Microstructural features affecting AM part properties are listed. Service properties of AM parts are described, including physical, mechanical, optical and electrical properties.

The list includes two sets of specifications, applied to two different quality categories of recyclable APW: one for pellet production process ("Quality I") and another one for plastic profile production process ("Quality II"). Parameters that are taken into consideration in the specifications include the APW physical characteristics, contamination, composition and degradation. The proposed specifications are focused on polyethylene based APW that represents the vast majority of the APW stream. However, the specifications can be adjusted to cover also APW of different materials (e.g. PP or PVC) that are found in very small quantities in protected cultivations in Europe. The adoption of the proposed specifications could transform this waste stream into a labelled commodity traded freely in the market and will constitute the base for the best economical and environmental valorisation of the APW. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The recent development of open-source 3-D printers makes scaling of distributed additive-based manu- facturing of high-value objects technically feasible and offers the potential for widespread proliferation of mechatronics education and participation. These self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) can manu- facture approximately half of their own parts from sequential fused deposition of polymer feedstocks. RepRaps have been demonstrated for conventional prototyping and engineering, customizing scientific equipment, and appropriate technology-related manufacturing for sustainable development. However, in order for this technology to proliferate like 2-D electronic printers have, it must be economically viable for a typical household. This study reports on the life-cycle economic analysis (LCEA) of RepRap technol- ogy for an average US household. A new low-cost RepRap is described and the costs of materials and time to construct it are quantified. The economic costs of a selection of 20 open-source printable designs (rep- resenting less than 0.02{\%} of those available), are typical of products that a household might purchase, are quantified for print time, energy, and filament consumption and compared to low and high Internet mar- ket prices for similar products without shipping costs. The results show that even making the extremely conservative assumption that the household would only use the printer to make the selected 20 products a year the avoided purchase cost savings would range from about {\$}300 to {\$}2000/year. Assuming the 25 h of necessary printing for the selected products is evenly distributed throughout the year these savings provide a simple payback time for the RepRap in 4 months to 2 years and provide an ROI between {\textgreater}200{\%} and {\textgreater}40{\%}. As both upgrades and the components that are most likely to wear out in the RepRap can be printed and thus the lifetime of the distributing manufacturing can be substantially increased the unavoidable conclusion from this study is that the RepRap is an economically attractive investment for the average US household already. It appears clear that as RepRaps improve in reliability, continue to decline in cost and both the number and assumed utility of open-source designs continues growing expo- nentially, open-source 3-D printers will become a mass-market mechatronic device},

Nous proposons des outils de diagnostic strat{\'{e}}gique pour les porteurs de chaque type d'open labs analys{\'{e}} dans cette {\'{e}}tude (entreprises, institutions acad{\'{e}}miques, organi- sations publiques, start ups). Ce Livre blanc permet de mieux comprendre les objectifs des open labs, leurs caract{\'{e}}ristiques en tant qu'espaces physiques et lieux d'{\'{e}}changes et de production, les pratiques, comme les d{\'{e}}marches d'open innovation qu'ils portent. Le pilotage des open labs varie en outre selon qu'ils sont issus d'initiatives individuelles ou qu'ils sont mis en place par des organisations. D'autres aspects portent sur la multidisciplinarit{\'{e}} au sein de l'open lab, et sur la vari{\'{e}}t{\'{e}} des comp{\'{e}}tences ou des profi ls qui contribuent {\`{a}} ses activit{\'{e}}s.

abstract = {Additive manufacturing processes are employed to create physical models from three-dimensional (3D) computer-Aided design (CAD) math data. A solid model or water-Tight surface model is used as the input, which is sliced into layers, and travel paths are created for each layer. The object is built by layer by layer stacking, with supporting structures for overhanging geometry and undercuts being created where necessary (process dependent). Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is an additive fabrication process that builds a part from extruded filaments of a melted thermoplastic. Several studies have focused on the depositing parameters; however, none of them have characterized internal support structures in different geometrical arrangements. The incorporation of reconfigurable parametric internal matrix structures based on primitive elements will balance the mechanical properties, the material usage and the build time. Parametric internal structures are designed, and compressive test components built and tested both experimentally and using simulation tools to depict the compressive characteristics. Extensive physical testing is done as the components built by the FDM process have anisotropic properties. The material usage, build time, and loading characteristics are captured for a variety of parametric structures (solid, shell, orthogonal, hexagonal, pyramid) build orientations, and internal densities (loose, compact). From this data, a model is developed that serves as a predictive tool to: (i) estimate the mechanical properties and (ii) calculate the build time and materials utilized based on various internal structural configurations for he component's application. A model that generates an optimal solution (minimum material, minimum build time, etc.) needs to be developed. Using the collected data as a foundation, an optimization model that considers the build time, material usage, surface finish, interior geometry, strength characteristics, and related parameters is presented and can be used to assist designers making informed decision with respect to strength, material usage and time, etc. is developed using the Genetic Algorithm approach. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Three-dimensional printing (3DP) has been employed to fabricate porous scaffolds by inkjet printing liquid binder droplets onto particulate matter. Direct 3DP, where the final scaffold materials are utilized during the actual 3DP process, imposes several limitations on the final scaffold structure. This study describes an indirect 3DP protocol, where molds are printed and the final materials are cast into the mold cavity to overcome the limitations of the direct technique. To evaluate the resolution available in this technique, scaffolds with villi features (500 ??m diameter, 1 mm height) were produced by solvent casting into plaster molds, followed by particulate leaching. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed highly open, well interconnected, uniform pore architecture (???100-150 ??m). The ability of these scaffolds to support intestinal epithelial cell (IEC6) culture was investigated in vitro. IEC6 cells attached to scaffolds uniformly in vitro and grew preferentially in the villi region. To exploit the freeform nature of this technique with large pore size, anatomically shaped zygoma scaffolds with 300-500 ??m interconnected pores were produced and characterized. Indirect 3DP provides an alternative method to complement other direct solid freeform fabrication methods. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Plastics have transformed everyday life; usage is increasing and annual production is likely to exceed 300 million tonnes by 2010. In this concluding paper to the Theme Issue on Plastics, the Environment and Human Health, we synthesize current understanding of the benefits and concerns surrounding the use of plastics and look to future priorities, challenges and opportunities. It is evident that plastics bring many societal benefits and offer future technological and medical advances. However, concerns about usage and disposal are diverse and include accumulation of waste in landfills and in natural habitats, physical problems for wildlife resulting from ingestion or entanglement in plastic, the leaching of chemicals from plastic products and the potential for plastics to transfer chemicals to wildlife and humans. However, perhaps the most important overriding concern, which is implicit throughout this volume, is that our current usage is not sustainable. Around 4 per cent of world oil production is used as a feedstock to make plastics and a similar amount is used as energy in the process. Yet over a third of current production is used to make items of packaging, which are then rapidly discarded. Given our declining reserves of fossil fuels, and finite capacity for disposal of waste to landfill, this linear use of hydrocarbons, via packaging and other short-lived applications of plastic, is simply not sustainable. There are solutions, including material reduction, design for end-of-life recyclability, increased recycling capacity, development of bio-based feedstocks, strategies to reduce littering, the application of green chemistry life-cycle analyses and revised risk assessment approaches. Such measures will be most effective through the combined actions of the public, industry, scientists and policymakers. There is some urgency, as the quantity of plastics produced in the first 10 years of the current century is likely to approach the quantity produced in the entire century that preceded.},

The rate of 3-D printable designs under open licenses is growing exponentially and there are already hundreds of designs applicable to small-scale organic farming. It has also been hypothesized that this technology could assist sustainable development in rural communities that rely on small-scale organic agriculture. To gauge the present utility of open-source 3-D printers in this organic farm context both in the developed and developing world, this paper reviews the current open-source designs available and evaluates the ability of low-cost 3-D printers to be effective at reducing the economic costs of farming. This study limits the evaluation of open-source 3-D printers to only the most-developed fused filament fab-rication of the bioplastic polylactic acid (PLA). PLA is a strong biodegradable and recyclable thermoplastic appropriate for a range of representative products, which are grouped into five categories of prints: hand tools, food processing, animal management, water management and hydroponics. The advantages and shortcomings of applying 3-D printing to each technology are evaluated. The results show a generalizable technical viability and economic benefit to adopting open-source 3-D printing for any of the technologies, although the individual economic impact is highly dependent on needs and frequency of use on a specific farm. Capital costs of a 3-D printer may be saved from on-farm printing of a single advanced analytical instrument in a day or replacing hundreds of inexpensive products over a year. In order for the full potential of open-source 3-D printing to be realized to assist organic farm economic resiliency and self-sufficiency, future work is outlined in five core areas: designs of 3-D printable objects, 3-D printing materials, 3-D printers, software and 3-D printable repositories.},

abstract = {This paper describes the fatigue behaviour of newly developed all-polypropylene (all-PP) tapes and composites, with reference to the composite processing conditions, testing temperature and making a comparison with commercial alternatives. All-PP tapes are highly oriented and their failure behaviour follows that of other highly oriented polymers. All-PP woven composites fail ultimately due to PP tape failure. However, this failure mode is accompanied by delamination of fabrics in the woven structure. Consolidation pressure plays a decisive role in controlling the interlaminar properties and hence the delamination resistance and furthermore the fatigue limit of the composite. Comparison of all-PP woven composites with commercial alternatives based on glass and natural fibres reveals the excellent relative performance of all-PP composites under fatigue loads. Fatigue properties of all-PP composites are however sensitive to the testing temperature, and elevated temperatures can lead to a rapid reduction of the fatigue resistance of these all-polymer systems.},

The paper gives a state-of-the-art overview of so called rapid prototyping techniques, like stereolithography, selective laser sintering, ballistic particle manufacturing and others. These are new manufacturing techniques in which the part is produced by gradually growing material to the required shape. A tentative classification and nomenclature is proposed. It is shown that those new processes are ideally suited for CIM. The paper tries to compare the different processes and discuss their application and performances.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional printing (3DP) is a versatile method to produce scaffolds for tissue engineering. In 3DP the solid is created by the reaction of a liquid selectively sprayed onto a powder bed. Despite the importance of the powder properties, there has to date been a relatively poor understanding of the relation between the powder properties and the printing outcome. This article aims at improving this understanding by looking at the link between key powder parameters (particle size, flowability, roughness, wettability) and printing accuracy. These powder parameters are determined as key factors with a predictive value for the final 3DP outcome. Promising results can be expected for mean particle size in the range of 20-35 ??m, compaction rate in the range of 1.3-1.4, flowability in the range of 5-7 and powder bed surface roughness of 10-25 ??m. Finally, possible steps and strategies in pushing the physical limits concerning improved quality in 3DP are addressed and discussed. ?? 2011 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Drummer2015,
abstract = {Concerning individualization, the requirements to products have increased. Additive manufacturing technologies, such as selective laser melting allow manufacturing of complex parts without tools and forms. Due to this additive manufacturing processes comply, in opposite to conventional techniques, with these increased demands on processing technology. Due to the high temperature during processing, a degradation of the used plastic powder occurs. The non-molten material in the building chamber, the so-called partcake, can be removed after building from the finished component and reused for another process. To realize reproducible part properties refreshing of partcake powder with 30 up to 50 {\%} virgin powder is necessary. However, these refreshing strategies lead to varying component properties due to an undefined aging state. Previous investigations on oven aged powder for selective laser melting showed for short periods of storage near the melting point thermally induced post condensation is the predominate aging effect. Due to post condensation the molecular weight and thus the viscosity increases. This paper focuses on the modeling of the post condensation process to define the aging state of polyamide 12 powder in laser melting process. Therefore the rheological behavior of PA 12 powder in dependency of time and temperature is investigated. Isothermal viscosity measurements are conducted in order to describe the post condensation$\backslash$r$\backslash$nreaction with a model. With knowledge of the kinetics of the post condensation$\backslash$r$\backslash$nreaction the state of aging can be predicted in a second step. Thus expected useful life of the powder can be calculated in dependency of the building chamber temperature. These results are then compared with viscosity values of defined aged PA 12 powder to validate the determined model.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

In terms of Taguchi experimental design techniques, an orthogonal array of experiments has been developed which has the least number of experimental runs and desired process parameter settings. Using a 3-D coordinate measuring machine and surface profilometer, a series of measurements in evaluating the SLA parts quality has been conducted to find the functional relationships between the output part quality and input manufacturing process parameters. Two analysis tools, response surface methodology and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), have been used to evaluate the SLA RP process and to perform the product optimization. The optimal setups of SLA manufacturing parameters for both individual features and a general part with various features have been concluded from this study.},

Despite a growing number of successful 3D printing applications, however, evidence of any displacement of traditional manufacturing is limited. In this paper we seek to separate hype surrounding DDM from economic reality in order to ground the future research agenda for the Operations Management field. By opposing direct digital manufacturing with traditional tool-based manufacturing, we show that direct digital manufacturing so far lags behind by several orders of magnitude compared to traditional manufacturing methods. Yet we also find that direct digital manufacturing clearly is on an improvement trajectory that eventually will see it being able to compete with traditional manufacturing on a unit cost basis. As such we conclude that direct digital manufacturing will increasingly challenge operations management researchers to question established practices such as scheduling, batch sizing and inventory management in low-volume, high-variety contexts. Furthermore, an increasing adoption of direct digital manufacturing will drive structural shifts in the supply chain that are not yet well understood. We summarize these challenges by defining the research agenda at factory, supply chain, and operations strategy level.},

This approach combines the major manufacturing technologies including additive, formative and subtractive fabrication, as well as their parallel integration. A 6-axis robotic arm, repurposed as an integrated 3D printing, milling and sculpting platform, enables shifting between fabrication modes and across scales using different end effectors. Promoting an integrated approach to robotic fabrication, novel combination processes are demonstrated including 3D printing and milling fabrication composites. In addition, novel robotic fabrication processes are developed and evaluated, such as multi-axis plastic 3D printing, direct recycling 3D printing, and embedded printing. The benefits and limitations of the Compound Fabrication approach and its experimental platform are reviewed and discussed.

abstract = {This paper is about designing spaces enabling processes of collaborative knowledge creation and innovation. It is a theoretical paper on the role of artifacts as enablers for creating new knowledge. We refer to these artifacts as Enabling Spaces comprising an architectural, technological (ICT), social, cognitive, organizational, cultural, as well as emotional dimension. The claim of this paper is that innovation is a highly challenging social and epistemological process which needs supporting (infra-)structures facilitating and enabling these processes. These processes have to take into account on various levels and domains in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner. It will be shown that innovation can no longer be understood as a mechanistic knowledge creation process. The concept of enabling will be developed as an alternative approach to innovation and will be applied as a design principle for Enabling Spaces. We will discuss the role of ICT in such an alternative approach to innovation. Finally, we will derive design principles for such highly interdisciplinary Enabling Spaces from these considerations.},

@article{Dodbiba2008,
abstract = {Two treatment options, i.e. energy recovery and mechanical recycling of plastic wastes from discarded TV sets, were compared in the context of life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. An estimate for the environmental burden of each option was calculated as the sum of the depletion of abiotic resources (ADP), the global warming potential (GWP), the acidification potential (AP), the photo-oxidant formation potential (POCP), the eutrophication potential (EP), and the human toxicity potential (HTP). After calculating the environmental burden of each treatment option, a sensitivity analysis was conducted. The ultimate aim was to indicate which parameters of the system have the strongest influence on the results of the LCA in order to find ways for lowering the environmental burden, and ultimately suggest a "design strategy" for TV sets. The main finding of this study was that mechanical recycling of plastics is more attractive treatment option in environmental terms than incineration for energy recovery, which generates a larger environmental burden. Finally, based on the results of sensitivity analysis, a "design strategy" was suggested, i.e. reducing the number of plastic types being used in the manufacturing process of TVs - preferably excluding the PVC. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Starr2011,
abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to measure the effect of process conditions on mechanical properties of laser-sintered nylon 12 (DuraformUP/UP) and to determine the range of conditions that provide consistent mechanical performance for additive manufacturing. Design/methodology/approach - Tensile test specimens were fabricated over a range of well-characterized process conditions including laser power, laser speed, scan spacing, layer thickness, build orientation, and build position. Tensile modulus, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and elongation-at-fracture were measured and related to process parameters. Findings - Tensile properties are strongly related to the amount of energy deposited during scanning. Strength and modulus approach their maximum values as the energy deposited exceeds the amount needed to fully melt the applied powder. Elongation-at-fracture does not reach its maximum until higher energy-melt ratio. Performance of blends with reused powder matches that of virgin powder when blend composition is adjusted to a standard melt-flow index. The volumetric energy density and the energy-melt ratio are useful for correlating mechanical properties with multiple process parameters and material thermal properties. Originality/value - This work presents the most extensive data to date on mechanical properties of nylon 12 (DuraformUP/UP) as they relate to the full range of process parameters. These data show that mechanical performance correlates strongly with the volume energy density. In contrast to the area energy density (a.k.a. Andrews Number), this volumetric parameter includes the effect of varying layer thickness and can be related directly to the melting characteristics of the polymer material. Within the parameter range studied, this relationship allows adjustment of one scan parameter for improved speed or dimensional accuracy while ensuring good strength by an offsetting adjustment of another parameter. Such trade-offs will be important in future manufacturing applications of the laser sintering process. Understanding the energy-melt ratio provides insight into the relationship between scan conditions and the physics of powder melting and sintering, and offers a methodology to relate results at other bed temperatures and with other polymer powders. {\&}copy; 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

@article{Gutowski2009,
abstract = {In this study we use a thermodynamic framework to characterize the material and energy resources used in manufacturing processes. The analysis and data span a wide range of processes from "conventional" processes such as machining, casting, and injection molding, to the so-called "advanced machining" processes such as electrical discharge machining and abrasive waterjet machining, and to the vapor-phase processes used in semiconductor and nanomaterials fabrication. In all, 20 processes are analyzed. The results show that the intensity of materials and energy used per unit of mass of material processed (measured either as specific energy or exergy) has increased by at least 6 orders of magnitude over the past several decades. The increase of material/energy intensity use has been primarily a consequence of the introduction of new manufacturing processes, rather than changes in traditional technologies. This phenomenon has been driven by the desire for precise small-scale devices and product features and enabled by stable and declining material and energy prices over this period. We illustrate the relevance of thermodynamics (including exergy analysis) for all processes in spite of the fact that long-lasting focus in manufacturing has been on product quality--not necessarily energy/material conversion efficiency. We promote the use of thermodynamics tools for analysis of manufacturing processes within the context of rapidly increasing relevance of sustainable human enterprises. We confirm that exergy analysis can be used to identify where resources are lost in these processes, which is the first step in proposing and/or redesigning new more efficient processes.},

@article{Sneddon2006,
abstract = {Not yet two decades after the publication of Our Common Future, the world's political and environmental landscape has changed significantly. Nonetheless, we argue that the concept and practice of sustainable development (SD)-as guiding institutional principle, as concrete policy goal, and as focus of political struggle-remains salient in confronting the multiple challenges of this new global order. Yet how SD is conceptualized and practiced hinges crucially on: the willingness of scholars and practitioners to embrace a plurality of epistemological and normative perspectives on sustainability; the multiple interpretations and practices associated with the evolving concept of "development"; and efforts to open up a continuum of local-to-global public spaces to debate and enact a politics of sustainability. Embracing pluralism provides a way out of the ideological and epistemological straightjackets that deter more cohesive and politically effective interpretations of SD. Using pluralism as a starting point for the analysis and normative construction of sustainable development, we pay particular attention to how an amalgam of ideas from recent work in ecological economics, political ecology and the "development as freedom" literature might advance the SD debate beyond its post-Brundtland quagmire. Enhanced levels of ecological degradation, vast inequalities in economic opportunities both within and across societies, and a fractured set of institutional arrangements for global environmental governance all represent seemingly insurmountable obstacles to a move towards sustainability. While these obstacles are significant, we suggest how they might be overcome through a reinvigorated set of notions and practices associated with sustainable development, one that explicitly examines the linkages between sustainability policies and sustainability politics. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is poised to bring about a revolution in the way products are designed, manufactured and distributed to end users. This technology has gained significant academic as well as industry interest due to its ability to create complex geometries with customizable material properties. AM has also inspired the development of the maker movement by democratizing design and manufacturing. Due to the rapid proliferation of a wide variety of technologies associated with AM, there is a lack of a comprehensive set of design principles, manufacturing guidelines, and standardization of best practices. These challenges are compounded by the fact that advancements in multiple technologies (for example materials processing, topology optimization) generate a “positive feedback loop” effect in advancing AM. In order to advance research interest and investment in AM technologies, some fundamental questions and trends about the dependencies existing in these avenues need highlighting. The goal of our review paper is to organize this body of knowledge surrounding AM, and present current barriers, findings and future trends significantly to the researchers. We also discuss fundamental attributes of AM processes, evolution of the AM industry, and the affordances enabled by the emergence of AM in a variety of areas such as geometry processing, material design and education. We conclude our paper by pointing out future directions such as the “print-it-all” paradigm, that have the potential to re-imagine current research and spawn completely new avenues for exploration.},

@article{Baumers2016,
abstract = {As part of the cosmos of digital fabrication technology, Additive Manufacturing (AM) systems are able to manufacture three-dimensional components and products directly from raw material and 3D design data. The layer-by-layer operating process of these systems does not require the use of tools, moulds or dies. Technology observers speculate that AM will have a profound economic impact on the manufacturing sector and indeed on wider society. By constructing a model of production cost for two different AM systems used commercially for the manufacture of end-use metal parts, Electron Beam Melting (EBM) and Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS), this paper performs an inter-process comparison of cost performance. High specific costs, measured at ??2.39 and ??6.18 per cm3 of material deposited respectively, are identified as a central impediment to more widespread technology adoption of such additive systems. The research demonstrates differing levels of system productivity, suggesting that the observed deposition rates are not sufficient for the adoption of EBM and DMLS in high volume manufacturing applications. Despite the absence of amortisable tooling costs, the analysis also reveals that economies of scale are achievable in AM. The results reached are further discussed in the light of the varying strategic requirements posed by the market-pull and technology-push modes of innovation which are both found in the AM industry.},

abstract = {This paper provides an introduction to some of the fundamental principles and approaches in environmental economics which are of significance to achieving an integrated sustainability science. The concept of a circular economy, introduced by the late David Pearce in 1990, addresses the interlinkages of the four economic functions of the environment. The environment not only provides amenity values, in addition to being a resource base and a sink for economic activities, it is also a fundamental life-support system. Environmental economists have suggested that, taking these four functions as an analytical starting point, unpriced or underpriced services should be internalised in the economy. In Europe significant advances have been achieved in the pricing of externalities by means of truly interdisciplinary analysis which accounts in detail for the environmental consequences. The monetary estimates reached as a result of such interdisciplinary research are gradually being applied to the economic analysis of environmental policy priorities. Although such figures provide only a partial and incomplete picture of the environmental costs at stake, they support and inform the analysis of the virtues of a circular economy for individual resources as well as for sustainability as a future trajectory.},

The process involves design of the tool using 3D CAD modeling, slicing of the data into cross sections, laser beam cutting of the sheets into 2D profiles, lamination, bonding, milling and finishing. This technology allows to include complex cooling channels in order to achieve a significant reduction of the cycle time and to control the cooling process. Because of the low bonding temperature and force, large tools can be made in a time- and cost-effective manner. The manufacturing system is similar to the technology developed by Nakagawa et al.; however, the used sheet material is different and therefore, the bonding method. In this article, the introduced bonding technique, laser cutting, milling and other important parameters such as bonding strength are discussed.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is a technology which has the potential not only to change the way of conventional industrial manufacturing processes, adding material instead of subtracting, but also to create entirely new production and business strategies. Since about three decades, AM technologies have been used to fabricate prototypes or models mostly from polymeric or metallic materials. Recently, products have been introduced into the market that cannot be produced in another way than additively. Ceramic materials are, however, not easy to process by AM technologies, as their processing requirements (in terms of feedstock and/or sintering) are very challenging. On the other hand, it can be expected that AM technologies, once successful, will have an extraordinary impact on the industrial production of ceramic components and, moreover, will open for ceramics new uses and new markets.},

abstract = {The outputs or products of an economy can be divided into services products and goods products (due to manufacturing, construction, agriculture and mining). To date, the services and goods products have, for the most part, been separately mass produced. However, in contrast to the first and second industrial revolutions which respectively focused on the development and the mass production of goods, the next - or third - industrial revolution is focused on the integration of services and/or goods; it is beginning in this second decade of the 21st Century. The Third Industrial Revolution (TIR) is based on the confluence of three major technological enablers (i. e., big data analytics, adaptive services and digital manufacturing); they underpin the integration or mass customization of services and/or goods. As detailed in an earlier paper, we regard mass customization as the simultaneous and real-time management of supply and demand chains, based on a taxonomy that can be defined in terms of its underpinning component and management foci. The benefits of real-time mass customization cannot be over-stated as goods and services become indistinguishable and are co-produced - as "servgoods" - in real-time, resulting in an overwhelming economic advantage to the industrialized countries where the consuming customers are at the same time the co-producing producers. {\textcopyright} 2012 Systems Engineering Society of China and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {As the number of prosumer printers has expanded rapidly, they now make up the majority of the 3-D printer market and of these printers those in the open-source lineage of the RepRap also have expanded to dominate. Although still primarily used for prototyping or hobbyist production of low-value products, the RepRap has the capacity to be used for high-value distributed manufacturing. A recent study found that RepRap printed parts printed in realistic environmental conditions can match and even out perform commercial 3-D printers using proprietary FDM in terms of tensile strength with the same polymers. However, tensile strengths of the large sample set of RepRap prints fluctuated. In order to explain that fluctuation and better inform designers on RepRap print properties this study determines the effect of color and processing temperature on material properties of Lulzbot TAZ deposited PLA in various colors. Five colors (white, black, blue, gray, and natural) of commercially available filament processed from 4043D PLA is tested for crystallinity with XRD, tensile strength following ASTM D638 and the microstructure is evaluated with environmental scanning electron microscope. Results are presented showing a strong relationship between tensile strength and percent crystallinity of a 3-D printed sample and a strong relationship between percent crystallinity and the extruder temperature. Conclusions are drawn about the effects of color and processing temperature on the material properties of 3-D printed PLA to promote the open-source development of RepRap 3-D printing.},

Creativity takes place in a physical context, i.e. in a confined space. Such space restricts and enables the free flow of sensory experiences and proximity of other people. The confinements may make certain sensory experiences available, e.g. vision of source material, sight and sound (including noise). This framing allows certain cognitive processes and restricts others. This may induce emotions that, in turn, facilitate or reduce the enhancement of creativity. Physical space affects the well-being of people, the channels of information, the availability of knowledge tools and sets the stage for coherence and continuity, which may contribute to competitive advantages.},

The quality effects in use for the analysis were signal-to-noise ratio and Resolution. Different matrixes, analyte/matrix proportions and the use of NaTFA as cationization agent were considered. A deep inspection of the statistical results provided a better understanding of the influence of the different factors, individually or in combination, to the signal. The application of DoE for the improvement of the MALDI measurement of PLA stated that the best combination of factors (levels) was the following: matrix (s-DHB), proportion analyte/matrix (1/5 V/V), and no use of cationization agent. Degradation primarily affected the initially predominant cyclic [LAC]n and linear H[LAL]nOH species, where LA stands for a PLA repeating unit. Intramolecular and intermolecular transesterifications as well as hydrolytic and homolytic reactions took place during the formation and disappearance of oligomeric species. In both degradation mechanisms induced by thermal ageing and thermo-mechanical degradation, the formation of H[LA L]nOCH3 by intermolecular transesterifications was highlighted. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Manufacturing paradigms have historically been shaped by social, economic, and technological aspect, including limitations and needs. Design for manufacturing (DFM) has been the main paradigm for last three decades since design is defined by the limitations of available manufacturing processes. Since reducing the time required for the development of new products has been one of the key issues for businesses, removing the gap between designers and manufacturers has been one of today's main goals. Many methods were developed to reduce this gap including information and communication technologies (ICT). However, current issues have been shifting towards design-related issues such that researchers have been trying to make products desired by the customers rather than that which is cheaper to manufacture. In this article, hybrid manufacturing (HM) and the concept of smart factory are introduced as key technologies for the future paradigm of manufacturing: Manufacturing for Design (MFD). Issues related to the development of HM process and examples of HM process are explained, and the importance of smart factories for the implementation of MFD is shown. Finally, future trends of HM and smart factory are predicted at the end of this article. {\textcopyright} 2016 Korean Society for Precision Engineering.},

abstract = {Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) has generated great interest as one of the most innovative materials being developed for a wide range of applications. The polymer is thermoplastic and biodegradable, which makes it highly attractive for biological and medical applications. It can be transformed by spinning into filaments for subsequent fabrication of desirable textile structures. Spinning may be accomplished by various routes, each with its merits and demerits. The medical applications of this polymer arise from its biocompatibility: the degradation product, lactic acid, is metabolically innocuous. The fibers may be fabricated into various forms and may be used for implants and other surgical applications such as sutures. Tissue engineering is the most recent domain where poly(lactic acid) is being used and is found to be one of the most favorable matrix materials. The present article presents a critical review on the production of poly(lactic acid) fiber by various methods, along with correlations between structure and properties of the fibers. The applications of these fibers in various domains are also discussed.},

abstract = {Keeping rheological, mechanical and thermal properties of virgin poly(ethylene terephthalate), PET, is necessary to assure the quality of second-market applications. A comparative study of these properties has been undertaken in virgin, mechanical recycled and commercial recycled PET samples. Viscoelastic characterization was carried out by rheological measurements. Mechanical properties were estimated by tensile and Charpy impact strength tests. Thermal properties and crystallinity were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry and a deconvolution procedure was applied to study the population of the different crystals. Molecular conformational changes related to crystallinity values were studied by FTIR spectroscopy. Variations in average molecular weight were predicted from rheology. Besides, the presence-absence of linear and cyclic oligomeric species was measured by mass spectrometry techniques, as MALDI-TOF. Mechanical recycled PET undergoes a significant decline in rheological, mechanical and thermal properties upon increasing the number of reprocessing steps. This is due to the cleavage of the ester bonds with reduction in molar mass and raise in cyclic oligomeric species, in particular [GTc]n and [GTc]n-G type. Chain shortening plus enrichment in trans conformers favour the crystallization process which occurs earlier and faster with modification in crystal populations. Additional physicochemical steps are necessary to preserve the main benefits of PET. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This article reports a new process chain for custom-made three-dimensional (3D) porous ceramic scaffolds for bone replacement with fully interconnected channel network for the repair of osseous defects from trauma or disease. Rapid prototyping and especially 3D printing is well suited to generate complex-shaped porous ceramic matrices directly from powder materials. Anatomical information obtained from a patient can be used to design the implant for a target defect. In the 3D printing technique, a box filled with ceramic powder is printed with a polymer-based binder solution layer by layer. Powder is bonded in wetted regions. Unglued powder can be removed and a ceramic green body remains. We use a modified hydroxyapatite (HA) powder for the fabrication of 3D printed scaffolds due to the safety of HA as biocompatible implantable material and efficacy for bone regeneration. The printed ceramic green bodies are consolidated at a temperature of 1250 degrees C in a high temperature furnace in ambient air. The polymeric binder is pyrolysed during sintering. The resulting scaffolds can be used in tissue engineering of bone implants using patient-derived cells that are seeded onto the scaffolds. This article describes the process chain, beginning from data preparation to 3D printing tests and finally sintering of the scaffold. Prototypes were successfully manufactured and characterized. It was demonstrated that it is possible to manufacture parts with inner channels with a dimension down to 450 microm and wall structures with a thickness down to 330 microm. The mechanical strength of dense test parts is up to 22 MPa.},

Recently, mouldless manufacturing techniques, known as solid free-form fabrication (SFF), or rapid prototyping, have been successfully used to fabricate complex scaffolds. Similarly, to achieve simultaneous addition of cells during the scaffold fabrication, novel robotic assembly and automated 3D cell encapsulation techniques are being developed. As a result of these technologies, tissue-engineered constructs can be prepared that contain a controlled spatial distribution of cells and growth factors, as well as engineered gradients of scaffold materials with a predicted microstructure. Here, we review the application, advancement and future directions of SFF techniques in the design and creation of scaffolds for use in clinically driven tissue engineering.},

As there is a strong emergence of new innovation laboratories all over the world, past experiences have shown that this type of projects are at risk to not succeed in their goals. The physical space is considered as a conscious asset to improve the innovation outcomes that must be carefully designed according with the strategic goals of the project. In the present paper, at first five frameworks from the literature are identified and compared. Then, based on both literature and authors' experience an updated framework is proposed as basis for a future guidance tool for researchers and practitioners aiming to adapt or to start a new laboratory.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional printing (3DP) represents a relative novel technology in manufacturing which is associated with potentially strong stimuli for sustainable development. Until now, research has merely assessed case study-related potentials of 3DP and described specific aspects of 3DP. This study represents the first comprehensive assessment of 3DP from a global sustainability perspective. It contains a qualitative assessment of 3DP-induced sustainability implications and quantifies changes in life cycle costs, energy and CO2 emissions globally by 2025. 3DP is identified to cost-effectively lower manufacturing inputs and outputs in markets with low volume, customized and high-value production chains as aerospace and medical component manufacturing. This lowers energy use, resource demands and related CO2 emissions over the entire product life cycle, induces changes in labour structures and generates shifts towards more digital and localized supply chains. The model calculations show that 3DP contains the potential to reduce costs by 170-593 billion US {\$}, the total primary energy supply by 2.54-9.30 EJ and CO2 emissions by 130.5-525.5 Mt by 2025. The great range within the saving potentials can be explained with the immature state of the technology and the associated uncertainties of predicting market and technology developments. The energy and CO2 emission intensities of industrial manufacturing are reducible by maximally 5{\%} through 3DP by 2025, as 3DP remains a niche technology. If 3DP was applicable to larger production volumes in consumer products or automotive manufacturing, it contains the (theoretical) potential to absolutely decouple energy and CO2 emission from economic activity.},

Therefore, it challenges companies to reinvent their business model-describing the logic of creating and capturing value. In this paper, we explore the implications that AM technologies have for manufacturing systems in the new business models that they enable. In particular, we consider how a consumer goods manufacturer can organize the operations of a more open business model when moving from a manufacturer-centric to a consumer-centric value logic. A major shift includes a move from centralized to decentralized supply chains, where consumer goods manufacturers can implement a "hybrid" approachwith a focus on localization and accessibility or develop a fully personalizedmodel where the consumer effectively takes over the productive activities of the manufacturer.We discuss some of the main implications for research and practice of consumer-centric business models and the changing decoupling point in consumer goods' manufacturing supply chains.},

abstract = {Concerns over climate change and the security of industrial feedstock supplies have been opening a growing market for biobasedmaterials. This development, however, also presents a challenge to scientists, policy makers, and industry because the production of biobased materials requires land and is typically associated with adverse environmental effects. This article addresses the environmental impacts of biobased materials in a meta-analysis of 44 life cycle assessment (LCA) studies. The reviewed literature suggests that one metric ton (t) of biobased materials saves, relative to conventional materials, 55±34 gigajoules of primary energy and 3 ± 1 t carbon dioxide equivalents of greenhouse gases. However, biobased materials may increase eutrophication by 5 ± 7 kilograms (kg) phosphate equivalents/t and stratospheric ozone depletion by 1.9 ± 1.8 kg nitrous oxide equivalents/t. Our findings are inconclusive with regard to acidification (savings of 2 ± 20 kg sulfur dioxide equivalents/t) and photochemical ozone formation (savings of 0.3 ± 2.4 kg ethene equivalents/t). The variability in the results of life cycle assessment studies highlights the difficulties in drawing general conclusions. Still, common to most biobased materials are impacts caused by the application of fertilizers and pesticides during industrial biomass cultivation. Additional land use impacts, such as the potential loss of biodiversity, soil carbon depletion, soil erosion, deforestation, as well as greenhouse gas emissions from indirect land use change are not quantified in this review. Clearly these impacts should be considered when evaluating the environmental performance of biobased materials.},

abstract = {Goal, Scope and Background. The object of the study is the Ital- ian system of plastic packaging waste recycling, active until 2001, that collected and mechanically recycled the post-consumer PE and PET liquid containers. The phases of collection, compaction, sorting, reprocessing and refuse disposal were individually ana- lysed and quantified in terms of energy and material consumptions as well as of emissions in the environment. The work is the result of a joint research project with the Italian Consortium for Pack- aging (CONAI), carried out in co-operation with the main Italian companies active in the field. The main aim was the quantifica- tion of the real advantage of plastic container recycling and the definition of criteria, at the same time environmentally compat- ible and economically sustainable, for their management. Main Features. For each of the unit processes, and in order to in- crease the data quality, all the data of interest were collected during technical visits to several selected plants active in Italy or deduced by official documents and certificate declarations of the same com- panies. To allow comparison of resource consumption and envi- ronmental pollution from different management scenarios produc- ing different products, the basket of products method was applied. Results. The results indicates that the production of I kg of flakes of recycled PET requires a total amount of gross energy that is in the range of between 42 and 55 M J, depending on whether the process wastes (mainly coming from sorting and reprocessing ac- tivities) were sent or not to the energy recovery. The same quan- tity of virgin PET requires more than 77 MJ. The energetic (and then environmental) saving is so remarkable, even for PE, being 40-49 MJ for the recycled polymer and about 80 MJ that for the virgin polyolefin. The calculations were made with the reason- able assumption that the final utilisation can use the virgin or the recycled polymer without any difference. Conclusions and Outlook. The analysis defined and verified a suitable tool in the field, based on objective data, for comparing different coherent scenarios of waste management politics. This allows one to propose the extension of the tool under different collection schemes, as well as for different systems of packaging recycling. As an immediate consequence of the success of the present study, the joint-research programme with CONAI has been extended for another three years. The focus will be the Italian system for paper and paperboard recycling and that for all plastic packagings. In parallel, a different study has been scheduled with reference to the integrated solid waste manage- ment of the Regione Campania, the largest and most populated area in the South of Italy.

abstract = {In this work we have analysed the properties of blends of recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) filled with talc. We have used two kinds of polymer matrices. The first one came entirely from ground injection moulded parts whereas the second was bimodal, incorporating 80{\%} of the previous HDPE and 20{\%} of recycled HDPE coming from bottles. We have also used two kinds of commercial talc characterized by a medium particle size of 2 $\mu$m and 10 $\mu$m, respectively. The amount of talc added to both matrices weighed of 10{\%} and 20{\%}. With regards to the mechanical properties of the analysed composites, greater values of Young's modulus and break stresses were found using a smaller particle size and higher talc content. On the other hand, the combination of the two HDPEs with very different viscosities produced a notable increase in the strain at break and in the absorbed energy; both measured at high and low strain rates. Despite the differences in viscosities between the two HDPEs, we did not observe separation of phases during either the processing or testing. Under impact loading, the higher energy absorption in the composites was observed when the finest talc grade with a 10{\%} content weight was added to the bimodal matrix. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The era of affordable 3D printing is clearly underway; indeed, the historical patterns of growth in 3D printing are, in many ways, strikingly similar to those associated with the growth of home computing in the late 1970's. One of the prominent areas of increased interest in 3D printing is in the realm of education: fabrication tools are becoming available to college undergraduates and high school students, and even to younger children. Accompanying this burgeoning growth, however, there is an acute need to consider the ways in which 3D printing should develop, as a technology, in order to accommodate the abilities and activities of youngsters. This paper discusses a number of technological challenges to be overcome in making 3D printing truly available to children over the next decade. The most prominent challenges described here include: (a) expanding the range of physical media available for printing, (b)incorporating ideas derived from pick-and-place mechanisms into 3D printing; (c) exploring methods for creating portable and ubiquitous printing devices; (d) creating tools for hand-customization and finishing of tangible printed objects and (e) devising software techniques for specifying; altering; and combining 3D elements in the context of printing. By facing these challenges; we can provide children (and adults) with a remarkably powerful and expressive means for creating all sorts of personalized, artifacts.},

The aim of this paper was therefore to identify different types of places and spaces central for the innovation milieus and processes of Living Lab projects, illustrate their impact on both process and results, and develop guidelines for space that can be designed in order to facilitate value-driven and democratized innovation. Based on a literature review and a cross case analyses different aspects of space, relevant for Innovation and Living Lab studies, have been identified: 1) local-global; 2) physical and digital, and 3) private-public. In the paper we focus on these concepts as tools for understanding present day innovation and we examples of how digital technology has influenced placement and permeability in relation to place and space.

abstract = {With the maturation of digital manufacturing technologies like 3-D$\backslash$r$\backslash$nprinting, a new paradigm is emerging of distributed manufacturing in both$\backslash$r$\backslash$nscientific equipment and consumer goods. Hardware released under free licenses$\backslash$r$\backslash$nis known as free and open source hardware (FOSH). The availability of these$\backslash$r$\backslash$nFOSH designs has a large value to those with access to digital manufacturing methods$\backslash$r$\backslash$nand particularly for scientists with needs for highly-customized low-volume$\backslash$r$\backslash$nproduction products. It is challenging to use traditional funding models to$\backslash$r$\backslash$nsupport the necessary investment of resources in FOSH development because of$\backslash$r$\backslash$nthe difficulty in quantifying the value of the result. In order to overcome$\backslash$r$\backslash$nthat challenge and harvest the current opportunity in both low-cost scientific$\backslash$r$\backslash$nequipment and consumer products, this article evaluates the following methods$\backslash$r$\backslash$nto quantify the value of FOSH design including: 1) downloaded substitution$\backslash$r$\backslash$nvaluation; 2) avoided reproduction valuation and 3) market savings valuation$\backslash$r$\backslash$nalong with additional benefits related to market expansion, scientific$\backslash$r$\backslash$ninnovation acceleration, educational enhancement and medical care improvement.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe strengths and weaknesses of these methods are analyzed and the results show$\backslash$r$\backslash$nthat the methods are relatively straight-forward to institute, based on$\backslash$r$\backslash$nreliable freely-available data, and that they minimize assumptions. A case$\backslash$r$\backslash$nstudy of a syringe pump with numerous scientific and medical applications is$\backslash$r$\backslash$npresented. The results found millions of dollars of economic value from a$\backslash$r$\backslash$nrelatively simple scientific device being released under open-licenses$\backslash$r$\backslash$nrepresenting orders of magnitude increase in value from conventional$\backslash$r$\backslash$nproprietary development. The inescapable conclusion of this study is that FOSH$\backslash$r$\backslash$ndevelopment should be funded by organizations interested in maximizing return$\backslash$r$\backslash$non public investments particularly in technologies associated with science,$\backslash$r$\backslash$nmedicine and education.},

A gender perspective is applied to examine whether women and men perceive leadership differently in different office types. Design/methodology/approach – Cross-sectional study is based on 5,358 office employees from the Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Study of Health in 2010. The employees worked in the seven different office types identified in contemporary office design: cell-offices, shared-room offices, small open plan offices, medium-sized open plan offices, large open plan offices, flex-offices, and combi-offices. Cell-office was used as reference in the analysis. Findings – Poorer ratings of leadership were found in shared-room offices, and better in medium-sized open plan offices. A tendency towards a gender difference in perceived leadership was found only in small open plan offices, which appear to be better for men and worse for women. Practi...},

abstract = {This paper investigates how Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies, as a process innovation, may contribute to a job creation. Further, the various mechanisms in which AM may contribute to an increase in job creation as well as the types of jobs are analyzed. The analysis also goes beyond AM technologies and incorporates other non-technological factors which foster job creation, i.e. higher wages in BRIC countries, lower quality in BRIC countries, and a rising demand for western-made products. The analysis is based on a case study and the data collected was through interviews with three prominent actors within the AM technologies field in Sweden: technology developers, leading suppliers and users. The main findings indicate that AM (i) contributes to job creation in both the manufacturing sector and in the service sector, (ii) does not bring back mass production jobs from emerging economies such as BRIC, (iii) contributes to job creation in product development stages (e.g. rapid prototyping), and (iv) contributes to job creation in production stages of low-volume batches mainly of complex products. The findings also suggest there are barriers for full exploitation of AM in several areas, including education systems.},

abstract = {Summary Three Dimensional Printing is a process for the manufacture of tooling and functional prototype parts directly from computer models. Three Dimensional Printing functions by the deposition of powdered material in layers and the selective binding of the powder by “ink-jet” printing of a binder material. Following the sequential application of layers, the unbound powder is removed, resulting in a complex three-dimensional part. The process may be applied to the production of metal, ceramic, and metal/ceramic composite parts. An experiment employing continuous-jet ink-jet printing technology has produced a three-dimensional part comprising eight intersecting planes spaced 0.375 inches apart. Future research will be directed toward the direct fabrication of cores and shells for metal casting, and toward the fabrication of porous ceramic preforms for metal-ceramic composite parts.},

abstract = {Cleaner production and sustainability are of crucial importance in the field of manufacturing processes where great amounts of energy and materials are being consumed. Nowadays, additive manufacturing technologies such as direct additive laser manufacturing allow us to manufacture functional products with high added value. Insofar as environmental considerations become an important issue in our society, as well as legislation regarding environment become prominent (Normalization ISO 14 044), the environmental impact of those processes have to be evaluated in order to make easier its acceptance in the industrial world. Some studies have been conducted on electric consumption of machine tools (standby consumption, in process consumption, etc.) but only a few studies take into account the whole existing environmental flows (material, fluids, electricity). This paper presents a new methodology where all flows consumed (material, fluids, electricity) are considered in the environmental impact assessment. This method coupled a global view required in a sustainable approach and an accurate evaluation of flow consumption in the machine. The methodology developed is based on a predictive model of flow consumption defined from the manufacturing path and CAD model of the part which will be produce. In order to get an accurate model of the process, each feature of the machine is modeled. The goal of this work is to integrate this model into the design loop for additive manufacturing parts. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag London 2013.},

@article{Lazarevic2010,
abstract = {A number of life cycle assessment (LCA) studies have been undertaken within the last 15 years comparing end-of-life treatment options for post-consumer plastic waste, including techniques such as: mechanical recycling, feedstock recycling, incineration with energy recovery and landfilling. These have attempted to support decisions in the formulation of waste management strategies and policies. In light of the introduction of life cycle thinking into European waste policies, specifically in relation to the waste hierarchy, a literature review of publically available LCA studies evaluating alternative end-of-life treatment options for plastic waste has been conducted. This has been done in order to: establish if a consensus exists as to the environmentally preferable treatment option for plastic waste; identify the methodological considerations and assumptions that have led to these conclusions; and determine the legitimacy of applying the waste hierarchy to the plastic waste stream. The majority of the LCA studies concluded that, when single polymer plastic waste fractions with little organic contamination are recycled and replace virgin plastic at a ratio of close to 1:1, recycling is generally the environmentally preferred treatment option when compared to municipal solid waste incineration. It has been found that assumptions relating to the virgin material substitution ratio and level of organic contamination can have a significant influence upon the results of these studies. Although a limited number of studies addressed feedstock recycling, feedstock recycling and the use of plastic waste as a solid recovered fuel in cement kilns were preferred to municipal solid waste incineration. Landfilling of plastic waste compared to municipal solid waste incineration proved to be the least preferred option for all impact categories except for global warming potential. Due to the uncertainty surrounding some assumptions in the studies, it cannot be said with confidence that the waste hierarchy should be applied to plastic waste management as a general rule. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Production of polymer waste powders by Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), an Additive Manufacturing (AM) process, is an impediment to its sustainable growth. The purpose of this study is to find proper utilization of these waste powders by developing filaments from these powders for Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process. In order to develop filament materials, polyamide powders PA 12 (Nylon material) are mixed with various weight percentages (12.5, 25, 37.5 and 50) of tungsten carbide to enhance mechanical properties. To determine the suitability of powder mixtures for FDM, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Melt flow index (MFI) tests are performed. A single screw extruder is used to process these powder mixtures to form filaments for testing. It is found that the addition of tungsten carbide has increased glass transition temperature, MFI and the strength of resulting polyamide-tungsten carbide composites. Moreover, filaments possess comparable and better strength than existing filaments, which are used to successfully build 3D parts from an FDM system.},

abstract = {Recycling of polymers has come to be a necessary part of the development of a sustainable society. Recycling of low price bulk polymers, to which group the polyolefins belong, is seen by many as a waste of time and resources when they simply may be energy recovered. Several life-cycle assessments (LCA) have, however, proven that it is also valuable to material recycle bulk polymers such as polyolefins. In many instances, polyolefins are in-plant recycled and used again in similar products, but they may also be separated and sorted from municipal solid waste. This paper will discuss recycled polyolefins, in particular their change in material properties and how to characterise these properties and show that these analyses are a basis for quality determination. In fact, an important vehicle for the success of recycled polymeric materials is to use a quality concept. Accurate determination of a series of polymeric properties will be the only way recycled polymeric materials can compete with virgin ones. Analytical methods useful in the quality concept are presented and discussed. In particular, three parameters are important for quality measurements. These are degree of degradation, polymer composition and presence of low molecular weight compounds (degradation products of polymer matrix and additives, initiator/catalysts, solvents, use-related e.g. fragrance or flavour etc.). For the future it is important to give recycled polymeric materials status as resources besides the fossil and renewable ones.},

In total, three kinds of staggered composites are designed by mimicking the structure of bone and nacre. These composite designs are realized by 3D printing a rigid plastic and a viscous elastomer simultaneously. Greatly-enhanced energy dissipation in the designed composites is observed from both the experimental results and theoretical prediction. The designed polymer composites have loss modulus up to ???500 MPa, higher than most of the existing polymers. In addition, their specific loss modulus (up to 0.43 km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}/s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) is among the highest of damping materials. The damping enhancement is attributed to the large shear deformation of the viscous soft matrix and the large strengthening effect from the rigid inclusion phase.},

The design, bill of materials and assembly instructions are globally available to anyone wishing to use them. Details are provided covering the use of the CAD software and the RepRap 3-D printer. The use of an open-source Rasberry Pi computer as a wireless control device is also illustrated. Performance of the syringe pump was assessed and the methods used for assessment are detailed. The cost of the entire system, including the controller and web-based control interface, is on the order of 5{\%} or less than one would expect to pay for a commercial syringe pump having similar performance. The design should suit the needs of a given research activity requiring a syringe pump including carefully controlled dosing of reagents, pharmaceuticals, and delivery of viscous 3-D printer media among other applications},

abstract = {This work deals with the problem of the optimum design of a sandwich panel made of carbon-epoxy skins and a metallic cellular core. The proposed design strategy is a multi-scale numerical optimisation procedure that does not make use of any simplifying hypothesis to obtain a true global optimum configuration of the system. To face the design of the sandwich structure at both meso and macro scales, a two-level optimisation strategy is employed: at the first level the goal is the determination of the optimum shape of the unit cell of the core (meso-scale) together with the material and geometric parameters of the laminated skins (macro-scale), while at the second level the objective is the design of the skins stacking sequence (skin meso-scale) meeting the geometrical and material parameters provided by the first-level problem. The two-level strategy is founded on the polar formalism for the description of the anisotropic behaviour of the laminates, on the NURBS basis functions for representing the shape of the unit cell and on the use of a genetic algorithm as optimisation tool to perform the solution search. To prove its effectiveness, the multi-scale strategy is applied to the least-weight design of a sandwich plate subject to constraints of different nature: on the positive-definiteness of the stiffness tensor of the core, on the admissible material properties of the laminated faces, on the local buckling load of the unit cell, on the global buckling load of the panel and geometrical as well as manufacturability constraints related to the fabrication process of the cellular core.},

abstract = {The development of low-cost desktop versions of three-dimensional (3D) printers has made these devices widely accessible for rapid prototyping and small-scale manufacturing in home and office settings. Many desktop 3D printers rely on heated thermoplastic extrusion and deposition, which is a process that has been shown to have significant aerosol emissions in industrial environments. However, we are not aware of any data on particle emissions from commercially available desktop 3D printers. Therefore, we report on measurements of size-resolved and total ultrafine particle (UFP) concentrations resulting from the operation of two types of commercially available desktop 3D printers inside a commercial office space. We also estimate size-resolved (11.5nm-116nm) and total UFP ({\textless}100nm) emission rates and compare them to emission rates from other desktop devices and indoor activities known to emit fine and ultrafine particles. Estimates of emission rates of total UFPs were large, ranging from {\~{}}2.0×1010{\#}min-1 for a 3D printer utilizing a polylactic acid (PLA) feedstock to {\~{}}1.9×1011{\#}min-1 for the same type of 3D printer utilizing a higher temperature acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) thermoplastic feedstock. Because most of these devices are currently sold as standalone devices without any exhaust ventilation or filtration accessories, results herein suggest caution should be used when operating in inadequately ventilated or unfiltered indoor environments. Additionally, these results suggest that more controlled experiments should be conducted to more fundamentally evaluate particle emissions from a wider arrange of desktop 3D printers. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

This paper presents an analytical framework for quantifying the environmental and economic benefits of DFR for plastic computer enclosures during the design process, using straightforward metrics that can be aligned with corporate environmental and financial performance goals. The analytical framework is demonstrated via a case study of a generic desktop computer enclosure design, which is recycled using a typical US "take-back" system for plastics from waste electronics. The case study illustrates how the analytical framework can be used by the enclosure designer to quantify the environmental and economic benefits of two important DFR strategies: choosing high-value resins and minimizing enclosure disassembly time. Uncertainty analysis is performed to quantify the uncertainty surrounding economic conditions in the future when the enclosure is ultimately recycled. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This alternatively developed FDM filament has been successfully used to fabricate sacrificial patterns for investment casting process (ICP). The process was started with investigating the melt flow index (MFI) of collected nylon-6 waste which was matched with the commercial FDM filament through reinforcement. Finally, single screw extruder of has been used for the development of FDM filament proportion with a mixture of 60{\%} nylon-6, 30{\%} Al and 30{\%} Al2O3 (by wt.). The resulting FDM patterns have been used in ICP for development of aluminum matrix composite (AMC). Taguchi L9 was used to investigate the affect of process parameters (volume of pattern, density of pattern and number of IC coatings) on dimensional accuracy of AMC developed. Apart from suggesting an alternative method for management and recycling of nylon-6 waste, the present research work also described a new approach for the development of AMC with tailor made properties.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this study is to explore the potential positive effects of the design of a physical organisational environment on the emergence of an organisational culture conducive to organisational creativity. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on an in-depth, longitudinal case study, the aim being to enhance understanding of how a change in physical space, including location, spatial organisation and architectonic details, supports cultural change. Findings - It is suggested that physical space plays an implicit yet significant role in the emergence of a culture conducive to organisational creativity. It appears from the case analysis that there are three aspects of culture in particular, equality, openness and collectivity, that may be positively affected by the design of an organisation's physical environment. Practical implications - The careful choice, planning and design of an organisation's physical location, layout and style can advance the appearance of an organisational culture conducive to creativity. Originality/value - The paper describes a longitudinal study comparing a case organisation before and after a change in its physical environment. The longitudinal data illustrates how a change in the spatial environment contributes to the emergence of a culture conducive to organisational creativity. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {In this study, involving additive manufacturing (AM) using electron beam melting (EBM), we have examined build defects which result from beam tripping, porosities (including unmelted or unsintered zones) due to excursions from optimal build parameters (especially variations in melt scan beam current and scan speed), and gas bubbles trapped in atomized Ti-6Al-4V starting powder as well as recycled powder, and retained in the build. At optimized build conditions we have also examined microstructure-mechanical property (hardness, tensile strength, and elongation) variations for multiple rake building and multiple melt scans using optical metallography and scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). These build variances cause cooling rate variances which promote $\alpha$-phase growth and variations in dislocation density, as well as $\alpha$-to-$\alpha$′ (martensite) phase changes, all of which produce some degree of mechanical property variations. These features (especially $\alpha$-to-$\alpha$' phase changes) are notable on comparing solid builds in comparison with a variety of mesh arrays where strut dimension and build-element complexities alter the cooling rates in a significant way. We illustrate these microstructure variations with corresponding variations in microindentation hardness measurements made directly on fine mesh (strut) structures. Finally, we have examined Ti-6Al-4V powder chemistries and solid build chemistries which for single-pass melt scans at optimized build conditions are shown to be relatively constant up to 40 cycles of powder reuse with the exception of Al content which was reduced by 10 to 15{\%} in solid builds at optimized conditions. However, Al loss in solid builds approached 25{\%} for multiple (2 and 3) melt scans, while no changes in Ar gas-bubble density were observed with changes in $\alpha$-phase (grain) width which increased from 3 $\mu$m for a single melt scan to 4.5 and 6 $\mu$m for 2 and 3 melt scans, respectively. Corresponding Rockwell C-scale (HRC) hardness varied from 37, 36, and 35, respectively; with ultimate tensile strengths exceeding 1.2 GPa at elongations of 12{\%} or higher for this melt scan sequence.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the capability of five desktop additive manufacturing (AM) machines based on the ability to produce a standard component. This work also developed a model/method for evaluating and ranking AM technologies based on select criteria that can facilitate purchasing decisions. A standard part was designed and printed on each machine, and evaluated based on dimensional accuracy and surface finish. Additionally, the machines were compared based on build time for single and multiple parts as well as material consumption and unit cost. The research highlights the differences between AM units and suggests a method by which to ascertain the differences. With the rapid proliferation of desktop additive manufacturing units, a quantitative ranking system was developed to rate the units so a comparison can be made. Although the focus of the work was on desktop systems, the approach can be applied across all AM technologies.},

The multitude of AM techniques which are being applied in a desktop format is a testament to society's acceptance and need for the technology. Robust evaluation and comparison of the various AM systems is necessary to fulfil AM's benefit to society.

Second, the Commons-oriented wind turbine examined here is also meant to practically contribute to the quest for novel solutions to the timely problem of the need for (autonomous) renewable sources of energy, more in the sense of a development process than as a ready-to-apply solution. We demonstrate that it is possible for someone with partial initial knowledge to initiate a similar, complex project based on an interesting idea, and to succeed in implementing it through collaboration with Commons-oriented communities, while using peer-produced products and tools. Given the trends and trajectories both of the current information-based paradigm and the problems of the predominant industrial modes of production with all the collateral damage they entail, this may be considered a positive message indeed.},

abstract = {This paper describes the fatigue behaviour of newly developed all-polypropylene (all-PP) tapes and composites, with reference to the composite processing conditions, testing temperature and making a comparison with commercial alternatives. All-PP tapes are highly oriented and their failure behaviour follows that of other highly oriented polymers. All-PP woven composites fail ultimately due to PP tape failure. However, this failure mode is accompanied by delamination of fabrics in the woven structure. Consolidation pressure plays a decisive role in controlling the interlaminar properties and hence the delamination resistance and furthermore the fatigue limit of the composite. Comparison of all-PP woven composites with commercial alternatives based on glass and natural fibres reveals the excellent relative performance of all-PP composites under fatigue loads. Fatigue properties of all-PP composites are however sensitive to the testing temperature, and elevated temperatures can lead to a rapid reduction of the fatigue resistance of these all-polymer systems.},

The conventional LOM process and the new LOM process are compared with reference to the theoretical manufacturing error. A slicing algorithm for the new LOM process has been deduced. The conclusions drawn from the experiments and analysis are shrinkage in the stack direction is small; atom diffusion between two joints occurs clearly and new grains form; the shear strength of the welding zone is above 100 MPa; the micro-hardness of the welding zone is almost the same as that of the substrate. The fabrication of sample part suggests that the new LOM process with diffusion welding could be a useful method for the rapid manufacturing of metal parts. ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A short history of the practice of plastics recycling as practiced in the United States and Europe for the past ten years indicates that much progress has been made in educating the public sector about the environmental damage done by the indiscriminating disposal of plastic items and potential opportunities to recycle them. Recent legislation has made the collection of some discarded plastic articles more efficient, and has provided economic incentives to recover and reuse waste plastics. A discussion of the methods of collecting, separating, cleaning, and fabrication of plastic wastes into useful items leads to the conclusion that much work is yet to be done to develop more efficient ways to perform these tasks. In addition, improvements in blending the disparate plastic materials in wastes could lead to the production of better products made from recycled materials. The public must be made aware of the fact that consumer products made of recycled plastics are often as good as those made of virgin material. And that the resulting environmental benefits as well as energy savings are for the common good. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {This study evaluated the emissions characteristics of hazardous material during fused deposition modeling type 3D printing. Particulate and gaseous materials were measured before, during, and after 3D printing in an exposure chamber. One ABS and two PLA (PLA1 and PLA2) cartridges were tested three times. For online monitoring, a scanning mobility particle sizer, light scattering instrument, and total volatile organic compound (TVOC) monitor were employed and a polycarbonate filter and various adsorbent tubes were used for offline sampling. The particle concentration of 3D printing using ABS material was 33−38 times higher than when PLA materials were used. Most particles were nanosize ({\textless}100 nm) during ABS (96{\%}) and PLA1 (98{\%}) use, but only 12{\%} were nanosize for PLA2. The emissions rates were 1.61 × 1010 ea/min and 1.67 × 1011 ea/g cartridge with the ABS cartridge and 4.27−4.89 × 108 ea/min and 3.77−3.91 × 109 ea/g cartridge with the PLA cartridge. TVOCs were also emitted when the ABS was used (GM; 155 ppb, GSD; 3.4), but not when the PLA cartridges were used. Our results suggest that more research and sophisticated control methods, including the use of less harmful materials, blocking emitted containments, and using filters or adsorbents, should be implemented.},

abstract = {The last four decades produced exponential development in the polymer processing. Radiation processing - initiated also about 40 years ago - yielded a similar pathway of development in the beginning, mostly in the radiation crosslinking of polymers and in the radiation sterilization of polymer products. There are some unexpected results in the developments of the radiation chemistry of polymers utilized well in the polymer processing today. The most dynamical developments of the microelectronics in our days are based on the efficient utilization of radiation-crosslinkable negative photoresist polymers and the radiation degradable positive photoresist polymers. Rapid prototyping and rapid tooling are indispensable methods in the continuously renewing manufacturing technologies of metal and plastic parts for almost all the industrial branches. Polymer composite manufacturing is also profited in many ways from the experiences of radiation technology. Compatibilization through radiation-reactive monomers and oligomers is attacking two great fields of the future polymer processing. Recycling of commingled polymer wastes, and manufacturing new type of alloys of different synthetic as well as natural polymers are requiring well-engineered interface, which can be achieved by radiation processing in a technically feasible and economically viable way. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

@article{Hopewell2009,
abstract = {Plastics are inexpensive, lightweight and durable materials, which can readily be moulded into a variety of products that find use in a wide range of applications. As a consequence, the production of plastics has increased markedly over the last 60 years. However, current levels of their usage and disposal generate several environmental problems. Around 4 per cent of world oil and gas production, a non-renewable resource, is used as feedstock for plastics and a further 3-4{\%} is expended to provide energy for their manufacture. A major portion of plastic produced each year is used to make disposable items of packaging or other short-lived products that are discarded within a year of manufacture. These two observations alone indicate that our current use of plastics is not sustainable. In addition, because of the durability of the polymers involved, substantial quantities of discarded end-of-life plastics are accumulating as debris in landfills and in natural habitats worldwide. Recycling is one of the most important actions currently available to reduce these impacts and represents one of the most dynamic areas in the plastics industry today. Recycling provides opportunities to reduce oil usage, carbon dioxide emissions and the quantities of waste requiring disposal. Here, we briefly set recycling into context against other waste-reduction strategies, namely reduction in material use through downgauging or product reuse, the use of alternative biodegradable materials and energy recovery as fuel. While plastics have been recycled since the 1970s, the quantities that are recycled vary geographically, according to plastic type and application. Recycling of packaging materials has seen rapid expansion over the last decades in a number of countries. Advances in technologies and systems for the collection, sorting and reprocessing of recyclable plastics are creating new opportunities for recycling, and with the combined actions of the public, industry and governments it may be possible to divert the majority of plastic waste from landfills to recycling over the next decades.},

abstract = {Packaging is expected to become the leading application for nano-composites by 2020 due to the great advantages on mechanical and active properties achieved with these substances. As novel materials, and although there are some current applications in the market, there is still unknown areas under development. One key issue to be addressed is to know more about the implications of the nano-composite packaging materials once they become waste. The present study evaluates the extrusion process of four nanomaterials (Layered silicate modified nanoclay (Nanoclay1), Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3), Silver (Ag) and Zinc Oxide (ZnO) as part of different virgin polymer matrices of polyethylene (PE), Polypropylene (PP) and Polyethyleneterephtalate (PET). Thus, the following film plastic materials: (PE-Nanoclay1, PE-CaCO3, PP-Ag, PET-ZnO, PET-Ag, PET-Nanoclay1) have been processed considering different recycling scenarios. Results on recyclability show that for PE and PP, in general terms and except for some minor variations in yellowness index, tensile modulus, tensile strength and tear strength (PE with Nanoclay1, PP with Ag), the introduction of nanomaterial in the recycling streams for plastic films does not affect the final recycled plastic material in terms of mechanical properties and material quality compared to conventional recycled plastic. Regarding PET, results show that the increasing addition of nanomaterial into the recycled PET matrix (especially PET-Ag) could influence important properties of the recycled material, due to a slight degradation of the polymer, such as increasing pinholes, degradation fumes and elongation at break. Moreover, it should be noted that colour deviations were visible in most of the samples (PE, PP and PET) in levels higher than 0.3 units (limit perceivable by the human eye). The acceptance of these changes in the properties of recycled PE, PP and PET will depend on the specific applications considered (e.g. packaging applications are more strict in material quality that urban furniture or construction products).},

abstract = {The overall objective of this work was to study the effect of reprocessing cycles of isotactic polypropylene (PP) on the rheological behavior and microstructure of gel-like dispersions in mineral oil. PP was subjected to 10 reprocessing cycles and oleogel samples were further prepared by using the mixing rheometry technique and characterized from a rheological point of view and polarized light optical microscopy (PLOM). Recycled polymer samples were also characterized by means of rheological measurements, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to evaluate the property changes induced by reprocessing. The values of different linear viscoelastic functions (elastic modulus and complex viscosity) of recycled PP decrease with the number of reprocessing cycles, which influences oleogel rheological response. An empirical exponential correlation between the storage modulus (G′) of PP samples and the plateau modulus (GNo) of oleogels has been proposed to predict the rheological behavior of oleogels. Results were explained considering the scission of PP chains induced by the thermomechanical reprocessing treatment applied.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has the potential to create geometrically complex parts that require a high degree of customization, using less material and producing less waste. Recent studies have shown that AM can be an economically viable option for use by the industry, yet there are some inherent challenges associated with AM for wider acceptance. The lack of standards in AM impedes its use for parts production since industries primarily depend on established standards in processes and material selection to ensure the consistency and quality. Inability to compare AM performance against traditional manufacturing methods can be a barrier for implementing AM processes. AM process sustainability has become a driver due to growing environmental concerns for manufacturing. This has reinforced the importance to understand and characterize AM processes for sustainability. Process characterization for sustainability will help close the gaps for comparing AM performance to traditional manufacturing methods. Based on a literature review, this paper first examines the potential environmental impacts of AM. A methodology for sustainability characterization of AM is then proposed to serve as a resource for the community to benchmark AM processes for sustainability. Next, research perspectives are discussed along with relevant standardization efforts.},

Digital manufacturing technologies have only recently become widespread and the return on investment (ROI) was not clear, so funding for open hardware development was historically sparse. This paper clarifies a method for determining an ROI for the development of sci- entific free and open source hardware (FOSH). By using an open source hardware design that can be manufactured digitally, the relatively minor development costs result in enormous ROIs for the scientific community. A case study is presented of a syringe pump released under open license, which results in ROIs for funders ranging from hundreds to thousands of percent after only a few months.

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this study is to explore the potential positive effects of the design of a physical organisational environment on the emergence of an organisational culture conducive to organisational creativity. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on an in-depth, longitudinal case study, the aim being to enhance understanding of how a change in physical space, including location, spatial organisation and architectonic details, supports cultural change. Findings - It is suggested that physical space plays an implicit yet significant role in the emergence of a culture conducive to organisational creativity. It appears from the case analysis that there are three aspects of culture in particular, equality, openness and collectivity, that may be positively affected by the design of an organisation's physical environment. Practical implications - The careful choice, planning and design of an organisation's physical location, layout and style can advance the appearance of an organisational culture conducive to creativity. Originality/value - The paper describes a longitudinal study comparing a case organisation before and after a change in its physical environment. The longitudinal data illustrates how a change in the spatial environment contributes to the emergence of a culture conducive to organisational creativity. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Purpose – To discuss integration of the rapid prototyping environmental aspects with the primary focus on electrical energy consumption. Design/methodology/approach – Various manufacturing parameters have been tested on three rapid prototyping systems: Thermojet (3DS), FDM 3000 (Stratasys) and EOSINT M250 Xtended (EOS). The objective is to select sets of parameters for reduction of electrical energy consumption. For this, a part is manufactured in several orientations and positions in the chamber of these RP systems. For each test, the electrical power is noted. Finally, certain rules are proposed to minimize this electrical energy consumption during a job. Findings – It is important to minimize the manufacturing time but there is no general rule for optimization of electrical energy consumption. Each RP system must be tested with energy consumption considerations under the spotlight. Research limitations/implications – The work is only based on rapid prototyping processes. The objective is to take into consideration the complete life-cycle of a rapid prototyped part: manufacturing of raw material as far as reprocessing of waste. Practical implications – Reduction of electrical energy consumption to complete a job. Originality/value – Currently, environmental aspects are not well studied in rapid prototyping.},

abstract = {Nitrate, the most oxidized form of nitrogen, is regulated to protect people and animals from harmful levels as there is a large over abundance due to anthropogenic factors. Widespread field testing for nitrate could begin to address the nitrate pollution problem, however, the Cadmium Reduction Method, the leading certified method to detect and quantify nitrate, demands the use of a toxic heavy metal. An alternative, the recently proposed Environmental Protection Agency Nitrate Reductase Nitrate-Nitrogen Analysis Method, eliminates this problem but requires an expensive proprietary spectrophotometer. The development of an inexpensive portable, handheld photometer will greatly expedite field nitrate analysis to combat pollution. To accomplish this goal, a methodology for the design, development, and technical validation of an improved open-source water testing platform capable of performing Nitrate Reductase Nitrate-Nitrogen Analysis Method. This approach is evaluated for its potential to i) eliminate the need for toxic chemicals in water testing for nitrate and nitrite, ii) reduce the cost of equipment to perform this method for measurement for water quality, and iii) make the method easier to carryout in the field. The device is able to perform as well as commercial proprietary systems for less than 15{\%} of the cost for materials. This allows for greater access to the technology and the new, safer nitrate testing technique.},

abstract = {Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has become the most favourable packaging material world-wide for beverages. The reason for this development is the excellent material properties of the PET material, especially its unbreakability and the very low weight of the bottles compared to glass bottles of the same filling volume. Nowadays, PET bottles are used for softdrinks, mineral water, energy drinks, ice teas as well as for more sensitive beverages like beer, wine and juices. For a long time, however, a bottle-to-bottle recycling of post-consumer PET packaging materials was not possible, because of the lack of knowledge about contamination of packaging polymers during first use or recollection. In addition, the decontamination efficiencies of recycling processes were in most cases unknown. During the last 20 years, PET recollection as well as recycling processes made a huge progress. Today, sophisticated decontamination processes, so-called super-clean recycling processes, are available for PET, which are able to decontaminate post-consumer contaminants to concentration levels of virgin PET materials. In the 1991, the first food contact approval of post-consumer PET in direct food contact applications has been given for post-consumer recycled PET in the USA. Now, 20 years after the first food approval of a PET super-clean recycling process, this article gives an overview over the world-wide progress of the bottle-to-bottle recycling of PET beverage bottles, e.g. the recollection amount of post-consumer PET bottles and the super-clean recycling technologies. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, unsintered powder can be recovered and recycled in subsequent builds to significantly decrease net costs. To improve blending protocols, the powder quality, i.e. the degree of degradation, was quantified using differential scanning calorimetry. Contrary to the work of others, the results suggested that the sensitivity of differential scanning calorimetry to small changes in molecular weight could reproducibly detect small changes in ovenaged (degraded) powder.},

abstract = {It is increasingly recognized that the growing metabolism of society is approaching limitations both with respect to sources for resource inputs and sinks for waste and emission outflows. The circular economy {\{}(CE){\}} is a simple, but convincing, strategy, which aims at reducing both input of virgin materials and output of wastes by closing economic and ecological loops of resource flows. This article applies a sociometabolic approach to assess the circularity of global material flows. All societal material flows globally and in the European Union {\{}(EU-27){\}} are traced from extraction to disposal and presented for main material groups for 2005. Our estimate shows that while globally roughly 4 gigatonnes per year {\{}(Gt/yr){\}} of waste materials are recycled, this flow is of moderate size compared to {\{}62{\~{}}Gt/yr{\}} of processed materials and outputs of {\{}41{\~{}}Gt/yr.{\}} The low degree of circularity has two main reasons: First, 44{\%} of processed materials are used to provide energy and are thus not available for recycling. Second, socioeconomic stocks are still growing at a high rate with net additions to stocks of {\{}17{\~{}}Gt/yr.{\}} Despite having considerably higher end-of-life recycling rates in the {\{}EU,{\}} the overall degree of circularity is low for similar reasons. Our results indicate that strategies targeting the output side (end of pipe) are limited given present proportions of flows, whereas a shift to renewable energy, a significant reduction of societal stock growth, and decisive eco-design are required to advance toward a {\{}CE.{\}}},

abstract = {Modeling the structure and evolution of products is important from the standpoint of improving quality and maintainability. With the increasing popularity of open-source processes for developing both software and physical systems, there is a need to develop computational models of product evolution in such dynamic product developments scenarios. Existing studies on the evolution of products involve modeling products as networks, taking snapshots of the structure at different time steps, and comparing the structural characteristics. Such approaches are limited because they do not capture the underlying dynamics through which products evolve. In this paper, we take a step toward addressing this gap by presenting a generative network model for product evolution. The generative model is based on different mechanisms though which networks evolve—addition and removal of nodes, addition and removal of links. The model links local network observations to global network structures. It is utilized for modeling and analyzing the evolution of a software product (Drupal) and a physical product (RepRap) developed by open source processes. For the software product, the generated networks are compared with the actual product structures using various network measures including average degree, density, clustering coefficients, average shortest path, propagation cost, clustered cost, and degree distributions. For the physical product, the product evolution is analyzed in terms of the proposed mechanisms. The proposed model has three general applications: longitudinal studies of a product's evolution, cross-sectional studies of evolution of different products, and predictive analyzes.},

The present study describes fully renewable thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs) consisting of synthesized biobased elastomer (PLBSI) and poly (lactic acid) (PLA) by in situ dynamic vulcanization for 3D-printed materials. The morphology study implied in situ dynamic vulcanization and phase inversion occurs and leads the PLBSI elastomer dispersed as microparticles in PLA matrix. Then, the morphological evolution mechanism was proposed and indicated the dispersed PLBSI elastomer microparticles are actually agglomerates of elastomer nanoparticles. The PLBSI/PLA TPVs perform good processability and reprocessability by rheological and recyclability tests. Besides, good in vitro degradability and cytotoxicity suggests PLBSI/PLA TPVs are promising sustainable biomaterials. The superior strength and elasticity confirmed by the tensile tests of 3D-printed samples, and firm microstructure and the reliable printed accuracy of 3D-printed samples investigated by SEM implied the PLBSI/PLA TPVs were ideal 3D-printing materials.},

Conclusions

The feasibility of printed components has been proved from a print time perspective.
There is potential for 3D printing small wind turbines but research is required to further qualigy and quantify this potential. The developed design serves as an effective platform for further design optimization and is particularly useful as an education and experimental tool.

HMA technique is presented with significant benefits of decreased print time and component cost.

Acetone vapor bath post processing treatment has been present with reduced surface stress concentrations resulting in improved toughness and strain characteristics.

Most experts agree that the lack of additive manufacturing (AM) standards is a key point to take into account in the barriers to broad adoption of AM. Although over the past two decades several entities and groups of experts have demanded the development of specific standards for additive manufacturing, the most important steps forward have been taken in the last few years, mainly through the actions of international organizations such as International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), with the support of technical groups and projects focused on the standardization of AM. This work, which is successfully providing new standards for AM, is expected to be reinforced by a global agreement between ASTM and ISO with the aim of collaboration on common AM standards. This paper presents a summary and review of actions carried out so far by different organizations and projects, based on the work of several road maps and workshops, with the aim of developing new standards in this particular field.},

abstract = {Sustainability is and will be a crucial issue for the present and future generations. The current assumption that natural resources are infinite and that the regenerative capacity of the environment is able to compensate for all human action is no longer acceptable. Hence, sustainability issues will influence all organisational aspects of the human life, from the economical, political, social and environmental points of view. The reason is simple: until now, all human activities have been based on the paradigm of unlimited resources and unlimited world's capacity for regeneration; from now on, the awareness of the termination of this assumption means that all related behavioural models must be changed. This is a very impressive objective embracing all fields of culture, economy, technology and much more. A continuing effort, together with a reasonable time span, will be required to pursue this goal. Fortunately, nature and the environment are capable of self-regulation and will give man a chance to recover from the damage he is causing to the earth mother, provided that the will to do so is firmly established. Manufacturing, as the main pillar of the civilised lifestyle, will be strongly affected by the sustainability issues and it will play an important role in establishing a sustainable way ahead. Today, nearly all manufacturing models are based on the old paradigm. Technology, on which the manufacturing is largely based, is asked, together with culture and economy, to give the tools and options for building new solutions towards a sustainable manufacturing concept. Generally speaking, new technology, new business models and new lifestyle models will be the cornerstones of the new sustainable world and this will be particularly true for what concerns the manufacturing sector. Impressive constraints and requirements will affect the industrial sector on the way ahead towards sustainability. Research and development will play a crucial role to this concern, having the responsibility to offer appropriate options to the society for answering the above-mentioned needs. The main evidences on researches challenges expected for sustainable manufacturing are outlined by the authors that have been involved in the IMS international project 'IMS2020: Supporting Global Research for IMS2020 Vision', promoted by the European Commission to prepare a roadmap for future (2020) manufacturing research. {\textcopyright} 2012 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

Individual and complex parts are directly produced from CAD data without the need of specific tools. The raw material is a polymer powder, which is deposited layerwise and melted selectively with a laser. Built parts are embedded in residual unmolten powder, the so-called part cake, which undergoes thermal ageing effects due to the exposure to high temperatures for long times during the manufacturing process. Hence, the recyclability of the unmolten powder is limited. This article focuses on a fundamental analysis of the ageing kinetics dependent on time, temperature, and oxygen content in the gas atmosphere. A model is developed and applied to measured, position-dependent process temperature histories to successfully predict the ageing distribution within a part cake. The results can be used to optimize the thermal process management in LS and to develop new efficient powder recycling methods.},

The characterization of these powders is important in NIST efforts to develop appropriate measurements and standards for additive materials and to document the property of powders used in a NIST-led additive manufacturing material round robin. An extensive array of characterization techniques was applied to these two powders, in both virgin and recycled states. The physical techniques included laser diffraction particle size analysis, X-ray computed tomography for size and shape analysis, and optical and scanning electron microscopy. Techniques sensitive to chemistry, including X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive analytical X-ray analysis using the X-rays generated during scanning electron microscopy, were also employed. Results of these analyses will be used to shed light on the question: how does virgin powder change after being exposed to and recycled from one or more additive manufacturing build cycles?

This paper compares the environmental and social impacts of a kerbside collection scheme for recyclable household waste, with a bring scheme, using lifecycle assessment. Economic valuation is used to assign relative weights to these impacts. A second comparison examines the relative external costs of recycling and landfill disposal of waste. The results show that the kerbside collection scheme has a lower external cost than the bring scheme, but this is of less importance than the benefits to be gained within the manufacturing system by using secondary materials.

As doing so requires a thorough understanding of the level of user involvement in productive processes and a clear view of the nature of co-creative processes, this article provides a ‘prosumption' framework and a typology of co-creation activities. Then, based on case studies of 22 online 3D printing platforms, a service-based taxonomy of these platforms is constructed. The taxonomy and typology are then matched to investigate the role played by online 3D platforms in regard to the various types of co-creation activities and, consequently, how this impacts user innovation.},

abstract = {The large amount of disposable bottles produced nowadays makes imperative the search for alternative procedures for recycling them since they are not biodegradable. This paper takes into consideration the thermomechanical recycling of post-consumed plastic bottles, especially the ones made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and their use as composite materials for engineering applications. As changes on the composite's microstructure can have an influence on macroscopic behavior, a new type of analysis is needed. To be able to evaluate the composite performance, a dual analysis procedure was developed. It consists of a micro-mechanical analysis where the microstructure is observed by optical microscopy, and variations in morphology are related to composite overall mechanical behavior. The macro-mechanical analysis is performed by ASTM D 3039/3039 M tensile tests. By doing this, the composite effective moduli can be determined. The new composite seems to be encouraging, i.e., an HDPE/PET composite with 40:60 ratio, in weight, experiments a stiffness recovery from the third to the fourth recycle. Moreover, the dual analysis was able to capture this variation. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The objective of this report is to propose comprehensive guidelines for systematic literature reviews appropriate for software engineering researchers, including PhD students. A systematic literature review is a means of evaluating and interpreting all available research relevant to a particular research question, topic area, or phenomenon of interest. Systematic reviews aim to present a fair evaluation of a research topic by using a trustworthy, rigorous, and auditable methodology. The guidelines presented in this report were derived from three existing guidelines used by medical researchers, two books produced by researchers with social science backgrounds and discussions with researchers from other disciplines who are involved in evidence-based practice. The guidelines have been adapted to reflect the specific problems of software engineering research. The guidelines cover three phases of a systematic literature review: planning the review, conducting the review and reporting the review. They provide a relatively high level description. They do not consider the impact of the research questions on the review procedures, nor do they specify in detail the mechanisms needed to perform meta-analysis.},

abstract = {An advantage of the powder-bed-based metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes is that the powder can be reused. The powder reuse or recycling times directly affect the affordability of the additively manufactured parts, especially for the AM of titanium parts. This study examines the influence of powder reuse times on the characteristics of Ti-6Al-4V powder, including powder composition, particle size distribution (PSD), apparent density, tap density, flowability, and particle morphology. In addition, tensile samples were manufactured and evaluated with respect to powder reuse times and sample locations in the powder bed. The following findings were made from reusing the same batch of powder 21 times for AM by selective electron beam melting: (i) the oxygen (O) content increased progressively with increasing reuse times but both the Al content and the V content remained generally stable (a small decrease only); (ii) the powder became less spherical with increasing reuse times and some particles showed noticeable distortion and rough surfaces after being reused 16 times; (iii) the PSD became narrower and few satellite particles were observed after 11 times of reuse; (iv) reused powder showed improved flowability; and (v) reused powder showed no measurable undesired influence on the AM process and the samples exhibited highly consistent tensile properties, irrespective of their locations in the powder bed. The implications of these findings were discussed.},

abstract = {We investigated the mechanical behavior of two-dimensional hierarchical honeycomb structures using analytical, numerical and experimental methods. Hierarchical honeycombs were constructed by replacing every three-edge vertex of a regular hexagonal lattice with a smaller hexagon. Repeating this process builds a fractal-appearing structure. The resulting isotropic in-plane elastic properties (effective elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio) of this structure are controlled by the dimension ratios for different hierarchical orders. Hierarchical honeycombs of first and second order can be up to 2.0 and 3.5 times stiffer than regular honeycomb at the same mass (i.e., same overall average density). The Poisson's ratio varies from nearly 1.0 (when planar 'bulk' modulus is considerably greater than Young's modulus, so the structure acts 'incompressible' for most loadings) to 0.28, depending on the dimension ratios. The work provides insight into the role of structural organization and hierarchy in regulating the mechanical behavior of materials, and new opportunities for developing low-weight cellular structures with tailorable properties. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {As additive manufacturing (AM) process evolves from rapid prototyping to the end-of-use product manufacturing process, manufacturing constraints have largely been alleviated and design freedom has been significantly broadened, including shape complexity, material complexity, hierarchical complexity, and functional complexity. Inevitably, conventional Design Theory and Methodology (DTM) especially life-cycle objectives oriented ones are challenged. In this paper, firstly, the impact of AM on conventional DTM is analyzed in terms of design for manufacturing (DFM), design for assembly (DFA), and design for performance (DFP). Abundance of evidences indicate that conventional DTM is not qualified to embrace these new opportunities and consequently underline the need for a set of design principles for AM to achieve a better design. Secondly, design methods related with AM are reviewed and classified into three main groups, including design guidelines, modified DTM for AM, and design for additive manufacturing (DFAM). The principles and representative design methods in each category are studied comprehensively with respect to benefits and drawbacks. A new design method partially overcoming these drawbacks by integrating function integration and structure optimization to realize less part count and better performance is discussed. Design tools as a necessary part for supporting design are also studied. In the meantime, the review also identified the possible areas for future research.},

abstract = {Thirty years into its development, additive man- ufacturing has become a mainstream manufacturing process. Additive manufacturing build up parts by adding materials one layer at a time based on a computerized 3D solid model. It does not require the use of fixtures, cutting tools, coolants, and other auxiliary resources. It allows design optimization and the producing of customized parts on-demand. Its advantages over conventional manufacturing have captivat- ed the imagination of the public, reflected in recent main- stream publications that call additive manufacturing “the third industrial revolution.” This paper reviews the societal impact of additive manufacturing from a technical perspec- tive. Abundance of evidences were found to support the promises of additive manufacturing in the following areas: (1) customized healthcare products to improve population health and quality of life, (2) reduced environmental impact for manufacturing sustainability, and (3) simplified supply chain to increase efficiency and responsiveness in demand fulfillment. In the mean time, the review also identified the need for further research in the areas of life-cycle energy consumption evaluation and potential occupation hazard assessment for additive manufacturing.},

The main effect of reprocessing for polypropylene was the decrease of molar mass due to degradation with chain scission, which was detected by the melt flow rate and the increase in crystallinity. Antioxidant consumption and material stability reduction with processing cycles were observed by the reduction of the thermo-oxidative stability detected by oxidative induction time measurements. The addition of antioxidants minimized degradation and maintained the stability of the material. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The effects of reprocessing cycles on the structure and properties of isotactic polypropylene (PP)/Cloisite 15A (OMMT) (5 wt. {\%}) nanocomposites was studied in presence of maleic anhydride-grafted-polypropylene (PP-g-MA) (20 wt. {\%}) used as the compatibiliser to improve the clay dispersion in the polymer matrix. The various nanocomposite samples were prepared by direct melt intercalation in an internal mixer, and further they were subjected to 4 reprocessing cycles. For comparative purposes, the neat PP was also processed under the same conditions. The nanocomposite structure and the clay dispersion have been characterized by wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and rheological measurements. Other characterization techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), tensile measurements, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) have also been used to evaluate the property changes induced by reprocessing. The study showed through XRD patterns that the repetitive reprocessing cycles modified the initial morphology of PP/OMMT nanocomposites by improving the formation of intercalated structure, especially after the fourth cycle. Further, the addition of PP-g-MA promoted the development of intercalated/exfoliated silicate layers in the PP matrix after the second cycle. These results are in agreement with TEM observations indicating an improved silicate dispersion in the polymer matrix with reprocessing cycles displaying a morphology with both intercalated/exfoliated structures. The initial storage modulus (G???) of the nanocomposites, which was highly improved in presence of PP-g-MA seems to be less affected by reprocessing cycles at very low frequencies exhibiting a quasi-plateau compared to pristine PP/OMMT and PP. In contrast, the complex viscosity was found to decrease for the whole samples indicating that the main effect of reprocessing was a decrease in the molecular weight. Moreover, the thermal and mechanical properties of the nanocomposites were significantly reduced after the first cycle; nevertheless they remained almost unchanged during recycling. No change in the chemical structure was observed in the FT-IR spectra for both the nanocomposites and neat PP samples after 4 cycles. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Organizations are invested to establish workspaces promoting innovation on various levels. These spaces are supposed to serve as a provider of resources, a facilitator of mindset and work modes, and as a communicator of the company's own culture. On an academic level, previous research has mostly focused on established physical environments, disregarding the usefulness and necessity of a preceding strategic intent. On a practical level, companies too often copy best practice examples of innovation labs without having a clear explicit intention. Based on the qualitative study of two organizations currently implementing an innovation lab, this paper introduces a collection of categories defining strategic intent preceding the establishment of innovation laboratories within organizations. Based on these, it becomes possible to compare the strategic intent of different compani)},

abstract = {The goal of the research was the determination of the properties and printability of polymeric materials made from the recycled polymers, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE). From the primary (virgin) polymers and secondary (recycled) polymers that were obtained from the separately collected fractions of waste packaging, compression moulded plates were produced. The tensile properties of 1. mm and 2. mm thin plates were correlated with some structural characteristics: melting point, melting enthalpy and crystallinity degree. It was determined that the recycling process changes the melting behaviour, lowers the crystallinity and to some extent influences the tensile properties of plates. LDPE and HDPE compression moulded plates were printed with the UV inks on the large format digital UV inkjet printer Oc?? Arizona. To investigate the printability of plates made from the recycled materials some of their surface properties were determined. Higher optical density, area of ink coverage and dot gain of the printed HDPE plates compared to the LDPE plates are the consequence of higher roughness, higher surface energy with prevailing part of the polar component. By adding 4{\%} of coloured master batch to the recycled polymer at moulding, the uniformity of colour is improved leading to the higher print quality. The results have shown that the digital UV inkjet printing technique could be applied for printing recycled polyethylene plastic materials, used for disposable low cost packaging products. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is an additive manufacturing (AM) method that relies on the thermal extrusion of a thermoplastic feedstock from a mobile deposition head. Conventional FFF constructs components from stacks of individual extruded layers using tool paths with fixed z-values in each individual layer. Consequently, the manufactured components often contain inherent weaknesses in the z-axis due to the relatively weak thermal fusion bonding that occurs between individual layers, as well as poor surface finish in shallow sloped contours. This study demonstrates the use of Curved Layer FFF (CLFFF) tool paths in tandem with a commercially available parallel, or delta, style FFF system to allow the deposition head to follow the topology of the component. By incorporating a delta robot and CLFFF tool paths in this way, improvements in the surface finish of the manufactured parts has been observed, and time costs associated with Cartesian robot based CLFFF manufacturing have been notably reduced. Furthermore, employing a delta robot provides additional flexibility to CLFFF manufacturing and increases the feasibility of its application for advanced manufacturing. The study has also demonstrated a viable approach to multi-material FFF by decoupling support structure and part manufacture into regions of CLFFF and static z tool pathing in an appropriate fashion.},

abstract = {The use of fused-filament 3D printing (FF 3DP) to fabricate individual tablets is demonstrated. The technology permits the manufacture of tablets containing drug doses tailored to individual patients, or to fabrication of tablets with specific drug-release profiles. Commercially produced polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) filament was loaded with a model drug (fluorescein) by swelling of the polymer in ethanolic drug solution. A final drug-loading of 0.29{\%} w/w was achieved. Tablets of PVA/fluorescein (10 mm diameter) were printed using a 3D printer. It was found that changing the degree of infill percentage in the printer software varied the weight and volume of the printed tablets. The tablets were mechanically strong and no significant thermal degradation of the active occurred during printing. Dissolution tests were conducted in modified Hank's buffer. The results showed release profiles were dependent on the infill percentage used to print the tablet. The study indicates that FF 3DP has the potential to offer a new solution for fabricating personalized-dose medicines or unit dosage forms with controlled-release profiles. In addition, the low cost of FDM printers means the paradigm of extemporaneous or point-of-use manufacture of personalized-dose tablets is both feasible and attainable.},

An overview of the types of bio-based polymers, their producers (including their location), the production processes applied and the types of uses shows that bio-based polymers is an emerging field which is characterised by new synergies and collaborations. In order to obtain a better understanding of the importance of this emerging sector estimates have been made firstly for the technical substitution potential and then for more realistic production scenarios which implicitly take into account price differentials and other influencing factors. The technical substitution potential, which can be derived from the material property set of each bio-based polymer and its petrochemicalbased equivalent is estimated at 15.4 million tonnes for EU-15, or 33{\%} of the total current polymer production. A more detailed analysis taking into account economic, social, ecological and technological influencing factors relating to the bio-based polymer value chain leads to the identification of three scenarios: WITHOUT P{\&}M (policies and measures), WITH P{\&}M and HIGH GROWTH. In absolute terms, biobased polymers are projected to reach a maximum of 1 million tonnes by 2010 in the scenario WITHOUT P{\&}M and max. 1.75-3.0 million tonnes by 2020 in the scenarios WITH P{\&}M and HIGH GROWTH respectively. These (physical) amounts are equivalent to an estimated maximum (monetary) production volume of roughly 1-2 billion EUR by 2010 (scenarios WITH P{\&}M and HIGH GROWTH) and 3-6 billion EUR by 2020 (scenario HIGH GROWTH).  While these are sizable quantities, they are modest compared to the expected production increase of petrochemical polymers by 12.5 million tonnes by 2010 and 25 million tonnes by 2020. Thus, the market share of bio-based polymers will remain very small, in the order of 1-2{\%} by 2010 and 1-4{\%} by 2020. This means that bio-based polymers will not provide a major challenge, nor present a major threat, to conventional petrochemical polymers. Energy and GHG emission savings from bio-based polymers in specific terms were found to be 20-50 GJ/t polymer and 1.0-4.0 t CO2eq/t polymer respectively (in Chapter 4.2.1). Bio-based polymers are thus very attractive in terms of specific energy and emissions savings. In absolute terms, savings are rather small: as a proportion of the total EU chemical industry, energy savings amount to 0.5-1.0{\%} by 2010, up to a maximum of 2.1{\%} by 2020; compared to the total EU economy the figures are 0.1{\%} until 2010 and 0.2{\%} until 2020 (Chapter 4.3.1). Greenhouse gas emissions savings amount to 1-2{\%} by 2010, up to a maximum of 5{\%} by 2020; compared to the total EU economy the figures are 0.1{\%} until 2010 and 0.2{\%} until 2020. Bio-based polymers therefore cannot offset the additional environmental burden due to the growth of petrochemical polymers (there is a gap of a factor of about 20 to 40). It is also out of the question that, within the next two decades, bio-based polymers will be able to meaningfully compensate for the environmental impacts of the economy as a whole.  However, it is not unthinkable that the boundary conditions for bio-based polymers and the energy system will change dramatically in the decades after 2020, e.g. due to substantially higher oil prices. If, ceteris paribus, bio-based polymers would ultimately grow ten times beyond the HIGH GROWTH projection for 2020 (i.e., to about 30 million tonnes), this could avoid half of the chemical sector's current GHG emissions, without accounting for major technological progress (efficiencies, yields) in the decades after 2020. These considerations for the very long term do not justify any concrete (policy) action today, they are rather intended to demonstrate the implications of the comparatively low production volumes until 2020 (compare also per capita values in Table 3-7). The results of the calculations on land use requirements (Chapter 4.3.1) show that by 2010 a maximum of 125,000 ha may be used for bio-based polymers in Europe and by 2020 an absolute maximum of 975,000 ha (High Growth Scenario). Comparing this with total land use in EU15 for various purposes, shows that if all bio-based polymers were to be produced from wheat, land requirements as a percentage of total land used to grow wheat range from 1{\%} WITH P{\&}M to 5{\%} in the case of HIGH GROWTH. As a proportion of total cereals these figures are a factor 2 lower. Compared to total set-aside land (1997 values), the percentage of land required ranges from 3.6{\%} to 15.4{\%}; as a percentage of industrial crops the range is similar. Bio-based polymers are thus seen to have modest land requirements and will not cause any strain within the EU on agricultural land requirements in the near future. As a consequence the employment potential in the agricultural sector is also very limited until 2020.  The assessment of the environmental impacts at the EU level is based on assumptions about the implementation of advanced technology (with lower environmental impact) and on the projections just discussed. At this early stage of development of bio-based polymers, many impacts which are likely to be significant cannot yet be assessed; other impact categories will only be identified as the transition from petroleum-based polymers to bio-based polymers progresses. The choice of reference product (1 tonne bulk polymer) and simplifying assumptions made in relation to the system boundaries do not allow for all end products to be taken into account; nor for all combinations of factors including locality, time, modes of transportation used and waste treatment technologies employed. The assessment of the environmental impacts is thus subject to large uncertainties. However, this uncertainty is inevitable since it is not feasible to account for all possible combinations of materials, end products and waste management, which, ideally, would need to be weighted with their respective future penetration rates. To develop a deeper understanding of the possible effects of policies and measures (P{\&}Ms) the society's willingness to pay for green electricity (from biomass) is translated to bio-based polymers; a level of 0.1-0.2 EUR per kg of bio-based polymer is found. It is concluded that this level of financial support would help to improve the competitiveness of bio-based polymers. A thorough discussion about the effects of P{\&}Ms would actually require a comprehensive overview of all existing fiscal measures and subsidies. A first attempt is made to quantify the effect related to the tax exemptions for the feedstock use of fossil fuels. According to our rough estimates this leads to an equivalent of 0.10 to 0.15 EUR/kg polymer, which – if verified – would have a number of important implications. The interviews and workshop held within the scope of this project also showed that it is not sufficient simply to lower the cost of bio-based polymers production and facilitate their market introduction. It is equally important to accompany this with R{\&}D activities in the field of polymer processing: Processors also must have access to the relevant additives which should be biodegradable, in order for the biopolymer to be fully biodegradable (examples given: dyes, anti-static additives). The report ends with an overview of relevant P{\&}Ms including brief explanations of the experience made to date in the EU and elsewhere. Finally, recent developments in policy making at the EU level are reported.},

The dataset consists of a recent and representative sample of Swedish AM users (companies, universities, and research institutes). The authors investigate two questions. Firstly, what are the current applications of AM in Sweden (e.g. Rapid Prototyping (RP), production)? Secondly, what are the factors that can explain the variation in AM adoption among the users? Using a regression analysis technique, the main findings are as follows. (i) There is a variation among users' choice of AM application, and the majority of users are expanding their AM applications beyond RP. (ii) There are two factors that positively affect the decision of firms to expand classical RP and also incorporate production and management. These two factors are using multiple AM technologies (as opposed to single Fused Deposition Modeling technology) and being small companies. The authors discuss the implication of these results.},

abstract = {Context: In a previous study, we reported on a systematic literature review (SLR), based on a manual search of 13 journals and conferences undertaken in the period 1st January 2004 to 30th June 2007. Objective: The aim of this on-going research is to provide an annotated catalogue of SLRs available to software engineering researchers and practitioners. This study updates our previous study using a broad automated search. Method: We performed a broad automated search to find SLRs published in the time period 1st January 2004 to 30th June 2008. We contrast the number, quality and source of these SLRs with SLRs found in the original study. Results: Our broad search found an additional 35 SLRs corresponding to 33 unique studies. Of these papers, 17 appeared relevant to the undergraduate educational curriculum and 12 appeared of possible interest to practitioners. The number of SLRs being published is increasing. The quality of papers in conferences and workshops has improved as more researchers use SLR guidelines. Conclusion: SLRs appear to have gone past the stage of being used solely by innovators but cannot yet be considered a main stream software engineering research methodology. They are addressing a wide range of topics but still have limitations, such as often failing to assess primary study quality. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper is a focus study to introduce an alternative approach to the existing ones, which could be taken to implement Additive Manufacturing (AM) systems for industrial applications. This approach is mainly based on the use of Product Service Systems (PSS) concept in order to turn AM into a more relevant field for service-based purposes within industrial applications. To do so, an AM profile, which is characterized with the similar notions forming the conceptual basis of PSS is detailed, and then the profile is framed for the new service oriented approach to highlight AM's competences in this field. Having found the interconnecting links between these two concepts, the intended approach for implementation would then be discussed and further developed in more detail to include the best use cases of the previous AM case studies as a guide on how to exploit AM's capabilities in similar ways, only modified for a given industrial business which is based on service development. The use cases would also introduce a few of the most successful examples in the production-service systems which have already taken advantage of three-dimensional printing (3D printing) which is one the subcategories of AM in lower tier (desktop) applications. These customer scale applications of 3D printing alongside portfolio analysis of AM in the field of industrial services could shed light for implementing further service-centric research in the advanced manufacturing systems.},

abstract = {A cleaner production pattern for high-performance continuous carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic composites (CFRTPCs) has been proposed on the base of recycling and remanufacturing of 3D printed continuous carbon fiber reinforced (CFR) PLA composites. Continuous carbon fiber and PLA matrix was recycled in the form of PLA impregnated carbon fiber filament from 3D printed composite components and reused as the raw material for further 3D printing process. The original printing trajectory is reversely applied, allowing for a 100{\%} recycling of the continuous fiber without any effect on the mechanical properties. Tensile performance of recycled carbon fiber filaments was evaluated, which was higher than that of originally printed composites. Remanufactured CFRTPCs specimens also exhibited a 25{\%} higher bending strength than that of original ones, which experimentally demonstrated the first non-downgrade recycling process for CFRTPCs. A material recovery rate of 100{\%} for continuous carbon fiber and 73{\%} for PLA matrix were achieved for a better environmental impact. Energy consumption of 67.7 and 66 MJ/kg respectively for recycling and remanufacturing processes was detected and compared with conventional methods. The proposed cleaner production pattern offered a potential strategy for the low-cost industrial application of fully recyclable composites.},

abstract = {1H NMR and MALDI-TOF MS measurements were used to study the thermo-mechanical and thermooxidative degradation mechanisms of bottle-grade PET (btg-PET). In the thermo-oxidative degradation, the concentration of low molar mass compounds increased with time and the main products were cyclic and linear di-acid oligomers. In the thermo-mechanical degradation, the main-chain scission reactions affect the stability of the cyclic oligomers. One of the most important bottle-grade PET co-monomers is diethylene glycol (DEG), which is a "reactive site" in the thermal degradation of btg-PET. The DEG co-monomer was shown to be the precursor to colour changes in btg-PET, owing to the attack by molecular oxygen on the methylenic protons adjacent to the ether oxygen atoms of DEG. This behaviourwas observed in the thermooxidative degradation process in which the degradation of DEG causes the release of hydroxyl radicals in the polymeric matrix, thereby producing mono- and di-hydroxyl substituted species. Thiswas also observed in the thermo-mechanical degradation process. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Metal additive manufacturing has emerged as a new manufacturing option for aerospace and biomedical applications. The many challenges that surround this new manufacturing technology fall into several different categories. The paper addresses one of these categories, the physical mechanisms that control the additive manufacturing process. Physical mechanisms control the effects of processing parameters on microstructures and properties of additively manufactured parts. Some mechanisms might not have been recognized, yet, and for those that are currently known, detailed quantitative predictions have to be established. The physical mechanisms of metal additive manufacturing are firmly grounded in metallurgy, branching into laser physics and the physics of granular materials. Powder bed additive manufacturing is described from the powder storage to post-processing and elements of metallurgy are highlighted that are relevant for the different aspects of the additive manufacturing process. These elements include the surface reactions on powder particles, the heating and melting behavior of the powder bed, solidification, and post-processing. This overview of the different metallurgical aspects to additive manufacturing is intended to help guide research efforts and it will also serve as a snapshot of the current understanding of powder bed additive manufacturing. 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {Following the rapid rise of distributed additive manufacturing with 3-D printing has come the technical development of filament extruders and recyclebots, which can turn both virgin polymer pellets and post-consumer shredded plastic into 3-D filament. Similar to the solutions proposed for other forms of ethical manufacturing, it is possible to consider a form of ethical 3-D printer filament distribution being developed. There is a market opportunity for producing this ethical 3-D printer filament, which is addressed in this paper by developing an “ethical product standard” for 3-D filament based upon a combination of existing fair-trade standards and technical and life cycle analysis of recycled filament production and 3-D printing manufacturing. These standards apply to businesses that can enable the economic development of waste pickers and include i) minimum pricing, ii) fair trade premium, iii) labor standards, iv) environmental and technical standards, v) health and safety standards, and vi) social standards including those that cover discrimination, harassment, freedom of association, collective bargaining and discipline.},

Propose ethical 3D printer filament distribution to apply to businesses. 


It includes (1) Minimum pricing, (2) fair trade premium, (3) labor standards, (4) environmental and technical conditions, (5) health and safety standards and (6) social standards.

Conclusion:

Market opportunity for producing ethical 3D printer filament  from five converging trends:

1.  Market for 3D printers is expanding.

2.        Exponential growth in free open source designs.

3.        Commercial filament is being sold large markups
4.        Waste plastic extruders have been developed
5.        There is a growing concern and interest among consumers for ethically produced products.
Therefore an ethical product standard have been developed.},

abstract = {This paper details the investigation of an emerging trend within technology development: open design. Improvements in communications and computing technology have made collaboration over geographically vast distances possible. This technology has already had a major impact on the field of engineering, from the development of CAD/CAE/CAM practices to the emergence of concurrent engineering. Taking the lead from open source software, open design is an approach to technology development in which technical design information is licensed in such a manner that it can be accessed, utilised, modified and redistributed by anyone. The potential implications of this concept can be inferred from the impact of open source software. A review of the existing literature on the subject was conducted. A practical demonstration of the process was undertaken, via an attempt to contribute to an existing open design technology: the RepRap. This is a low cost rapid prototyper capable of manufacturing the parts required to make a copy of itself. The ability to use resin as a construction material was identified as a requirement of the device. An approach to integrating resin extrusion within the device was selected, a suitable material identified, and an experimental rig designed and assembled. Initial test results indicated that resin extrusion is viable for the RepRap.},

abstract = {3D printing technology can produce complex objects directly from computer aided digital designs. The technology has traditionally been used by large companies to produce fit and form concept prototypes ('rapid prototyping') before production. In recent years however there has been a move to adopt the technology as full-scale manufacturing solution. The advent of low-cost, desktop 3D printers such as the RepRap and Fab@Home has meant a wider user base are now able to have access to desktop manufacturing platforms enabling them to produce highly customised products for personal use and sale. This uptake in usage has been coupled with a demand for printing technology and materials able to print functional elements such as electronic sensors. Here we present formulation of a simple conductive thermoplastic composite we term 'carbomorph' and demonstrate how it can be used in an unmodified low-cost 3D printer to print electronic sensors able to sense mechanical flexing and capacitance changes. We show how this capability can be used to produce custom sensing devices and user interface devices along with printed objects with embedded sensing capability. This advance in low-cost 3D printing with offer a new paradigm in the 3D printing field with printed sensors and electronics embedded inside 3D printed objects in a single build process without requiring complex or expensive materials incorporating additives such as carbon nanotubes.},

abstract = {Purpose ? This purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the steps and processes behind successfully adapting novel materials, namely virgin glass and recycled glass, to three?dimensional printing (3DP).Design/methodology/approach ? The transition from 3DP ceramic systems to glass systems will be examined in detail, including the necessary modifications to binder systems and printing parameters. The authors present preliminary engineering data on shrinkage, porosity, and density as functions of peak firing temperature, and provide a brief introduction to the complexities faced in realizing an adequate and repeatable firing method for 3D printed glass.Findings ? Shrinkage behavior for the 3D printed recycled glass showed significant anisotropy, especially beyond peak firing temperatures of 730°C. The average shrinkage ratios for the slow? and fast?axes to the Z?axis were 1:1.37 and 1:2.74, respectively. These extreme differences can be attributed to the layer?by?layer production method and binder burn?off. At 760°C, the apparent porosity reached a minimum of 0.36 percent, indicative of asymptotic behavior that approaches a fully dense 3DP glass specimen. At low firing temperatures, the bulk density was similar to water, but increased to a maximum of 2.41?g/cm3. This indicates that 3DP recycled glass can behave similarly to common glass with accepted published bulk densities ranging from 2.4?2.8?g/cm3.Research limitations/implications ? Heating schedule analysis and optimization may reduce geometric variations, therefore, the firing method should be investigated in greater depth.Originality/value ? This paper provides a guide to successfully adopting glass to commercially available 3DP hardware. This research has also enabled rapid prototyping of recycled glass, a monumental step towards a sustainable future for 3DP.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is sensitive to powder variability when applying fine layers in a uniform manner. This demands a high degree of consistency and repeatability in the feedstock. Particle size is often used as a critical quality attribute, but this is not sufficient to fully qualify a feedstock. Indeed, it is inadequate to suggest that any parameter from a single test, e.g., Hall flowmeter or Hausner ratio, can comprehensively describe a powder's characteristics. This article uses four case studies to demonstrate the limitations of single parameter characterization and how the rheological properties of several metal powders used in AM applications are used to establish in-process performance. In the first study, the significantly reduced permeability and increased specific energy of a one batch of powder demonstrate a clear link to poor layer uniformity. The second study investigates the impact of metal powder manufacturing methods and suppliers, and it shows how shear properties alone cannot be relied on to identify properties that influence the process. The effect of additives on the processability of polymer blends used in AM is also evaluated, and the results show that even small quantities can have a significant effect on the permeability and basic flowability energy of feedstocks. The final study demonstrates the how rheological measurements can be used to identify the optimum blend of fresh and used material when reusing metal powders to manufacture components. These case studies illustrate the ability of a modern powder rheometer to detect minor variations in powders that are directly relevant to performance in AM processes in a way that traditional characterization methods cannot. {\textcopyright} 2015, The Minerals, Metals {\&} Materials Society.},

abstract = {In contrast to subtractive manufacturing techniques, additive manufacturing processes are known for their high efficiency in regards to utilisation of feedstock. However the various polymer, metallic and composite feedstocks used within additive manufacturing are mainly derived from energy consuming, inefficient methods, often originating from non-sustainable sources. This work explores the mechanical properties of additively manufactured composite structures fabricated from recycled sustainable wood waste with the aim of enhancing mechanical properties through glass fibre reinforcement. In the first instance, samples were formed by pouring formulation of wood waste (wood flour) and thermosetting binder (urea formaldehyde), with and without glass fibres, into a mould. The same formulations were used to additively manufacture samples via a layered deposition technique. Samples manufactured using each technique were cured and subsequently tested for their mechanical properties. Additively manufactured samples had superior mechanical properties, with up to 73{\%} increase in tensile strength compared to moulded composites due to a densification of feedstock/paste and fibre in-situ directional alignment.},

Sustainable biocomposites should satisfy several requirements: (i) renewable and/or recycled resources should be utilized for their manufacture; (ii) the synthetic, modification, and processing operations should be benign and energy effective; (iii) no hazardous environmental or toxicological effects should arise during any stage of their life cycle; and (iv) their waste management options should be implemented. The future integration of biorefineries and green chemistry will guarantee the availability of a wide range of raw materials for their preparation. The emission of volatile organic compounds and the release of nanoparticles should be evaluated from a toxicological and environmental point of view.

abstract = {While NASA explores the power of 3D printing in the development of the next generation space exploration vehicle, a CubeSat Trailblazer was launched in November 2013 that integrated 3D-printed structures with embedded electronics. Space provides a harsh environment necessary to demonstrate the durability of 3D-printed devices with radiation, extreme thermal cycling, and low pressure - all assaulting the structure at the atomic to macroscales. Consequently, devices that are operational in orbit can be relied upon in many terrestrial environments - including many defense and biomedical applications. The 3D-printed CubeSat module (a subsystem occupying approximately 10 {\%} of the total volume offered by the 10∈×∈10∈×∈10-cm CubeSat enclosure) has a substrate that fits specifically into the available volume - exploiting 3D printing to provide volumetric efficiency. Based on the best fabrication technology at the time for 3D-printed electronics, stereolithography (SL), a vat photopolymerization technology, was used to fabricate the dielectric structure, while conductive inks were dispensed in channels to provide the electrical interconnect between components. In spite of the structure passing qualification - including temperature cycling, shock and vibration, and outgas testing - the photocurable materials used in SL do not provide the level of durability required for long-term functionality. Moreover, the conductive inks with low-temperature curing capabilities as required by the SL substrate material are widely known to provide suboptimal performance in terms of conductivity. To address these challenges in future 3D-printed electronics, a next generation machine is under development and being referred to as the multi3D system, which denotes the use of multiple technologies to produce 3D, multi-material, multifunctional devices. Based on an extrusion process necessary to replace photocurable polymers with thermoplastics, a material extrusion system based on fused deposition modeling (FDM) technology has been developed that integrates other technologies to compensate for FDM's deficiencies in surface finish, minimum dimensional feature size, and porosity. Additionally, to minimize the use of conductive inks, a novel thermal embedding technology submerges copper wires into the thermoplastic dielectric structures during FDM process interruptions - providing high performance, robust interconnect, and ground planes - and serendipitously improving the mechanical properties of the structure. This paper compares and contrasts stereolithography used for 3D-printed electronics with the FDM-based system through experimental results and demonstrates an automated FDM-based process for producing features not achievable with FDM alone. In addition to the possibility of using direct write for electronic circuitry, the novel fabrication uses thermoplastics and copper wires that offer a substantial improvement in terms of performance and durability of 3D-printed electronics. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract = {The combustion process of virgin and reprocessed polylactide (PLA) was simulated by multi-rate linear non-isothermal thermogravimetric experiments under O(2). A complete methodology that accounted on the thermal stability and emission of gases was thoroughly developed. A new model, Thermal Decomposition Behavior, and novel parameters, the Zero-Decomposition Temperatures, were used to test the thermal stability of the materials under any linear heating rate. The release of gases was monitored by Evolved Gas Analysis with in-line FT-IR analysis. In addition, a kinetic analysis methodology that accounted for variable activation parameters showed that the decomposition process could be driven by the formation of bubbles in the melt. It was found that the combustion technologies for virgin PLA could be transferred for the energetic valorization of its recyclates. Combustion was pointed out as appropriate for the energetic valorization of PLA submitted to more than three successive reprocessing cycles.},

Using of recycled powder affects the part structure and mechanical properties. Therefore, the paper aims to develop a suitable strategy to improve the part structure by controlling the most important SLS process parameters. The main process parameter whose influence was studied is the energy density of the laser beam. Special sample was designed and prototyped using EOS P100 prototyping machine. Three repetition jobs with different energy density of the laser beam were performed. Scanning Electron Microscopy was used to analyze the surface morphology and microstructure of the sintered benchmark parts. The relationship between the SLS parameters and part quality will extend the use of PA2200 recycled material. {\textcopyright} (2012) Trans Tech Publications.},

abstract = {Organizational ‘innovation laboratories', dedicated facilities for encouraging creative behaviours and supporting innovative projects, have received scant academic attention despite their increasing popularity with a range of different practitioners. This paper develops an initial theoretical explanation of the phenomenon, based upon notions of organizational learning and dynamic capabilities. This framework is then used as the basis for analysing the structure, infrastructure, benefits and dis-benefits of three UK-based laboratory facilities (mass service, government department, academic institution). Preliminary conclusions suggest that the ‘innovation laboratory' can offer real benefits for organizations: reinforcing corporate commitment to innovation and creativity by providing a physical manifestation of dynamic capability and double-loop learning concepts. Although the physical design of the space is central to its functionality – emphasizing dislocation from day-to-day activity, eliminating hierarchy, encouraging participation – direct facilitation remains critical to successful operation. There are also dis-benefits associated with what can be substantial financial investments and there is some evidence that such facilities can have a relatively short useful lifespan. Given the limited nature of the empirical base, the paper concludes with some specific suggestions for further work.},

A substantial portion of the existing research focuses on designing new sets of heuristics, demonstrating the interest in heuristics that might identify specific usability problems for specific application domains. This article presents an exhaustive review of 73 studies related to usability heuristics for specific domains and methodologies; the objective is to identify the approach that is used to create usability heuristics and whether a formal and systematic process is involved. We conducted a systematic literature review of papers published between 2006 and 2016. The review was based on the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham (2007) [13] and shows that most studies use an informal process to develop usability heuristics. The creation of heuristics is mainly based on existing heuristics, literature reviews, usability problems, and guidelines. However, a few studies apply a methodology to define, validate and refine the set of heuristics proposed. Nevertheless, these methodologies should be formalized in order to help the process of creating usability heuristics.},

abstract = {This article assesses the use of 'science fiction' (SF) in visioning or prototyping the potential economic and social consequences of so-called 3D printing. What is becoming clear to many commentators as well as science fiction writers is how rapid prototyping, or 3D printing more generally, could permit many final objects to be made near to or even by consumers on just-in-time 'printing' machines. This revolution in making would have many implications for the economy-and-society in the future by seriously augmenting, or possibly replacing, current systems of manufactured production, long-distance transportation and consumption. These 3D technologies have featured in SF works, including Neal Stephenson's The Diamond Age, Ian McDonald's Brasyl, Charles Stross's Rule 34 and Cory Doctorow's Makers. The article reports on current research seeking to understand the implications of what may be a major new sociotechnical system in the making. Some creative uses of SF are presented in a professional workshop setting. As well the article documents the use of SF as a methodological prototype in forecasting alternative scenarios of the future. SF prototyping could be a powerful tool in the social science repertoire when put into action in forecasting possible technology and business futures. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

What is fuelling this growth and where is the demand for coworking coming from? We tried to address this question by looking at the specific needs of the rising creative class, identifying their urgent need for uninhibited sharing of information, knowledge, ideas and also material resources. We argue that coworking spaces are favoured by the creative class, because they offer a community of work which facilitates the culture of sharing. To illustrate what it takes to establish such a community of work, we present a case study of the Creative Centre Poligon which suggests that community building is a multi-step process that needs careful management and plenty of time. We conclude that policy makers should not focus on building coworking spaces in order to combat youth unemployment but should rather support existing initiatives that have been built or are in the process of building up vibrant communities of work.},

Amongst the different classes of biodegradable polymers, the thermoplastic aliphatic poly(esters) like poly(lactide) (PLA), poly(glycolide) (PGA), and especially the copolymer of lactide and glycolide, poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) have generated immense interest due to their favorable properties such as good biocompatibility, biodegradability, and mechanical strength. Also, they are easy to formulate into different devices for carrying a variety of drug classes such as vaccines, peptides, proteins, and micromolecules. Also, they have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for drug delivery.

abstract = {This paper reviews the role of space in facilitating innovation. It draws on the sociology of space in exploring the social practices, institutional forces and material complexity of how people and spaces interact. We assess how space influences the development of innovative solutions to challenges in the health sector. Our aim is to advance an understanding of the social production of space for healthcare innovation. We draw empirical examples from the Innovation Hub at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town to illustrate that innovation does not take place in an institutional vacuum, but requires space that facilitates interaction of different players. This paper demonstrates that space matters in promoting innovation, particularly through its influence on social relationships and networks. An attractive and novel space, which is different from the usual workplace, stimulates innovation, mainly through being a base for the creation of an ecosystem for the productive interaction of different players. The interaction is important in inspiring new ideas, facilitating creative thought processes, maintaining the flow of information and bringing innovation to life.},

abstract = {The recent development of the RepRap, an open-source self-replicating rapid prototyper, has made 3-D polymer-based printers readily available to the public at low costs ( {\textless} {\$}500). The resultant uptake of 3-D printing technology enables for the first time mass-scale distributed digital manufacturing. RepRap variants currently fabricate objects primarily from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA), which have melting temperatures low enough to use in melt extrusion outside of a dedicated facility, while high enough for prints to retain their shape at average use temperatures. In order for RepRap printed parts to be useful for engineering applications the mechanical properties of printed parts must be known. This study quantifies the basic tensile strength and elastic modulus of printed components using realistic environmental conditions for standard users of a selection of open-source 3-D printers. The results find average tensile strengths of 28.5 MPa for ABS and 56.6 MPa for PLA with average elastic moduli of 1807 MPa for ABS and 3368 MPa for PLA. It is clear from these results that parts printed from tuned, low-cost, open-source RepRap 3-D printers can be considered as mechanically functional in tensile applications as those from commercial vendors.},

This study quantifies the basic tensile strength and elaxstic modulus of printed components using realistic environmental conditions for standards users of a selection of open source 3D printers


Conclusion:

The results show that the average tensile strength of RepRap printed parts is 28.5 MPa for ABS and 56.6 MPa for PLA with an average elastic modulus of 1807 MPa and  3368 MPa for PLA.

These results indicate that the 3D printed components from RepRaps are comparable in tensile strength and elastic modulus to the parts printed on commercial 3D printing systems.

As a result of increasing consumption of PVC-made products in recent years, the quantity of used PVC items entering the waste stream is gradually increased. Currently, there is a considerable public concern about the problem of plastic wastes, from which PVC has not escaped and the material or energy recycling may be a suitable way to overcome this problem. This review considers the various aspects of the PVC recycling such as recycling methods of PVC, special problems about some proposed processes, separation techniques, and recycling of mixed PVC wastes. In addition, an attempt is made to portray the current status of PVC recycling, the most recent technologies of recycling, and some recent scientific research in the field. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Today these technologies are proliferating worldwide in various forms of advanced manufacturing. The largest segment of the 3D printing market today involves various polymer component fabrications, particularly complex structures not attainable by other manufacturing methods. Conventional printer head systems have also been adapted to selectively print various speciated human cells and special molecules in attempts to construct human organs, beginning with skin and various tissue patches. These efforts are discussed along with metal and alloy fabrication of a variety of implant and bone replacement components by creating powder layers, which are selectively melted into complex forms (such as foams and other open-cellular structures) using laser and electron beams directed by CAD software. Efforts to create a ???living implant??? by bone ingrowth and eventual vascularization within these implants will be discussed briefly. Novel printer heads for direct metal droplet deposition as in other 3D printing systems are briefly described since these concepts will allow for the eventual fabrication of very large and complex products, including automotive and aerospace structures and components.},

In fact, a remarkable cost reduction can be obtained if the component shape is modified to exploit AM potentialities. This paper deals with the evaluation of the production volume for which AM techniques result competitive with respect to conventional processes for the production of end-usable metal parts. For this purpose, a comparison between two different technologies for metal part fabrication, the traditional high-pressure die-casting and the direct metal laser sintering additive technique, is done with consideration of both the geometric possibilities of AM and the economic point of view. A design for additive manufacturing approach is adopted. Costs models of both processes are identified and then applied to an aeronautical component selected as case study. This research evidences that currently additive techniques can be economically convenient and competitive to traditional processes for small to medium batch production of metal parts. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

abstract = {3D printing of polymeric materials for various applications has been quickly developed in recent years. In contrast to thermoplastics, 3D printed thermosets, although desirable, are inherently non-recyclable due to their permanently crosslinked networks. As 3D printing is becoming more popular, it is desirable to develop recycling approaches for 3D printed parts in view of increasing polymer wastes. Here, we present a new thermosetting vitrimer epoxy ink and a 3D printing method that can 3D print epoxy into parts with complicated 3D geometries, which later can be recycled into a new ink for the next round of 3D printing. In the first printing cycle, a high-viscous ink is first slightly cured and is then printed at an elevated temperature into complicated 3D structures, followed by an oven cure using a two-step approach. To be recycled, the printed epoxy parts are fully dissolved in an ethylene glycol solvent in a sealed container at a high temperature. The dissolved polymer solution is reused for the next printing cycle using similar printing conditions. Our experiments demonstrate that the ink can be printed four times and still retains very good printability. In addition, the vitrimer epoxy can be used for pressure-free repairs for the 3D printed parts.},

abstract = {Just as the power of the open-source design paradigm has driven down the cost of software to the point that it is accessible to most people, the rise of open-source hardware is poised to drive down the cost of doing experimental science to expand access to everyone. To assist in this aim, this paper introduces a library of open-source 3-D-printable optics components. This library operates as a flexible, low-cost public-domain tool set for developing both research and teaching optics hardware. First, the use of parametric open-source designs using an open-source computer aided design package is described to customize the optics hardware for any application. Second, details are provided on the use of open-source 3-D printers (additive layer manufacturing) to fabricate the primary mechanical components, which are then combined to construct complex optics-related devices. Third, the use of the open-source electronics prototyping platform are illustrated as control for optical experimental apparatuses. This study demonstrates an open-source optical library, which significantly reduces the costs associated with much optical equipment, while also enabling relatively easily adapted customizable designs. The cost reductions in general are over 97{\%}, with some components representing only 1{\%} of the current commercial investment for optical products of similar function. The results of this study make its clear that this method of scientific hardware development enables a much broader audience to participate in optical experimentation both as research and teaching platforms than previous proprietary methods.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing with 3-D printers may be a key technology enabler for entrepreneurs seeking to use disruptive innovations such as business models utilizing distributed manufacturing. Unlike centralized manufacturing, distributed manufacturing makes the parts and products (the prints) at (or closer to) the source of the demand, cutting out much of the traditional supply chain. Although many expect 3-D printing to take off at the household level and previous work has shown significant returns for those choosing to do so, there are still significant barriers to entry for typical consumers. Our analysis demonstrates that for an individual to make an abnormally high return on their investments in 3-D printers, they must serve others to achieve high utilization rates. The impetus to do so is created by a service that can undercut traditionally manufactured products due to affordability and customizability. Low-cost, open-source 3-D printers are now priced within range of individual entrepreneurs who can take advantage of the long tail of consumers with highly varied interests. The margin advantage, net present value, and return on investment (ROI) analysis provided herein could form the basis of thousands of new small-business ventures in the coming years. {\textcopyright} 2015 Springer-Verlag London},

abstract = {Polymer recycling is a way to reduce environmental impacts of accumulation of polymeric waste materials. However, low recycling rates are often observed in conventional centralized recycling plants mainly to the challenge of collection and transportation for high-volume low-weight-polymers in conventional centralized recycling plants. As the democratization of open-source 3D printers is going forward thanks to initiatives such as FabLab environments, there is a growing interest on how to use this technology to improve the efficiency of use of raw materials. Studies have been proposed in order to recycle waste polymer into open-source 3D printer feedstock. The recycling of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) issued from bottles of used milk jugs through use of an open-source filament fabricator system called RecycleBot has been evaluated. In this study, we propose an evaluation of the mechanical recyclability of Polylactic Acid (PLA), material widely used in the open-source 3D printing context, in order to establish the viability of this recycled material to be used in the open-source 3D printers. The degradation of the material's mechanical and rheological properties after a number of cycles of multiple extrusion and printing processes is evaluated. The characterization of recycled raw materials for open-source 3D printing has implications not only to reduce the environmental impact of polymers waste, but also it will allow us to understand the technical requirements and challenges for development of open-source filament recycle machine/process. The coupling of open-source 3D printers and filament extruders can offer the bases of a new distributed polymer recycling paradigm, which reverses the traditional paradigm of centralizing recycling of polymers where is often uneconomic and energy intensive due to transportation embodied energy. Moreover, this characterization also will allow the exploration of new source of materials and new composite materials for open-source 3D printing, in order to improve the quality of products made by this technology.},

@article{Huhtelin2015,
abstract = {It is argued in general that future success in effective innovation creation is built on the ability to connect and manage talent, partnerships and related practical innovation processes. This makes it challenging for a university to develop an ecosystem of knowledge creation. The full benefit from a university can only be obtained if the university and society are organically linked together. The needs of society have to be at the centre of a university's activities, and flexible adjustment to changing needs is necessary but often lacking. Campus management has a major role in the facilitation of multidisciplinary interaction between students, scientists, entrepreneurs and other industry partners that inspire each other with different perspectives on the same subject. One significant tool to support open innovation with diverse stakeholders is to provide supportive spaces with relevant services. This paper aims to identify the requirements of a Co-creation Centre as a concept serving the third role of auniversity. The literature review was conducted and, based on the result, this paper proposes a conceptual framework for capturing the key requirements for developing a multiuser Co-creation Centre. The framework consists ofthe requirements on the demand and supply sides of campus management. The main findings in this paper are that different modes of knowledge conversion have different capabilities tosupport knowledge co-creation requirements. Knowledge co-creation process requirements in the multiuser Co-creation Centre for university–industry collaboration are best supported by originating “Ba”, which means the place where individuals share feelings, emotions, experiences, and mental models and the place where the knowledge-creation process begins. The results contribute to the concept development in campus management and provide a starting point for evaluating the success of multidisciplinary and multi-actor innovation environments.},

abstract = {Limited material options, prohibitively expensive equipment, and high production costs currently limit the ability of small and medium enterprises to use 3D printing to prototype and manufacture metallic goods. A low-cost open-source 3D metal printer that utilizes gas metal arc welding technology has been developed that could make metal printing accessible to the average consumer. Unfortunately, this technology would demand access to expensive cutting tools for part removal from the substrate. This article investigates several substrate treatments to provide a low-cost method to easily remove 3D-printed 1100 aluminum parts from a reusable substrate. Coatings of aluminum oxide and boron nitride on 1100 aluminum and A36 low-carbon steel substrates were tested. Lap shear tests were performed to assess the interlayer adhesion between the printed metal part and the print substrate. No warping of the substrate was observed during printing. It was determined that boron nitride-coated low-carbon steel provided the lowest adhesion strength. Printing aluminum on uncoated low-carbon steel also allowed easy removal of the aluminum part with the benefit of no additional coating steps or costs.},

abstract = {In the product development process, companies require fast and inexpensive tooling to produce or evaluate components, enabling them to bring their products to market faster and more efficiently. Time to market directly influences the profitability of a new product. As timescales are reduced and risk levels rise, the demands on prototypes increase. Prototypes are needed faster, to be more accurate and more representative of the final component. Only the companies being first into the market can survive in this highly competitive marketplace. Business today requires everything faster. Additive manufacturing techniques are speeding up the availability of prototype parts. Additive manufacturing (AM) is an engineering tool to assist with changes and a means of improving communication and reducing risk. AM has the potential of creating short run and end-use tooling which can shorten the product development cycle significantly. The short lead time of AM tooling can significantly reduce cost and time to market. Hence, AM has enabled industry to benefit from different rapid tooling techniques such as investment casting, vacuum casting, metal spray tooling, and Keltool. Direct approaches to rapid tooling do not require the production of a pattern. Direct rapid tooling (DRT) involves no intermediate steps during the process of tool fabrication and potentially impact overall cost and part accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The increasing usage of polymeric materials and the greater range of requirements in product design lead to the combined use of more than one material in the same product, component, the so-called multi-material products. These products represent a risk for the environment, as they make the conventional recycling process more complicated. The main problem in recycling polymeric multi-material products is related to the difficulty in separating their components. Thus, it is necessary to find solutions to allow multi-material recycling without the need to separate these materials. In this context, this study aimed to analyze the technical feasibility for the application of micronization in recycling polymeric multi-material products and to evaluate the potential of the resulting materials for use in new products. Therefore, a theoretical part, focusing on polymeric multi-material products and micronization, and a practical study, consisting of multi-material toothbrushes recycled via micronization, were presented. The experimental investigation involved the micronization of multi-material toothbrushes, followed by extrusion and injection molding. Subsequently, the resulting material was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), tensile strength test and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). The results showed that micronization is a potential process to promote the recycling of multi-material products, and there was no degradation during the process. The recycled micronized material had a low level of interaction with the LLDPE matrix, which affected the elongation at break, causing loss of ductility and tenacity compared to virgin LLDPE. However, it did not affect the tensile strength, which presented an increase of 18.43{\%} compared to the reference. Despite better performance in tensile strength, the recycled sample showed an intense decrease in the storage modulus in temperatures above 30 °C. This may limit the use of these materials in certain products. Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that the resulting material has potential applications in new products.},

abstract = {This overview highlights some of the key aspects regarding materials qualification needs across the additive manufacturing (AM) spectrum. AM technology has experienced considerable publicity and growth in the past few years with many successful insertions for non-mission-critical applications. However, to meet the full potential that AM has to offer, especially for flight-critical components (e.g., rotating parts, fracture-critical parts, etc.), qualification and certification efforts are necessary. While development of qualification standards will address some of these needs, this overview outlines some of the other key areas that will need to be considered in the qualification path, including various process-, microstructure-, and fracture-modeling activities in addition to integrating these with lifing activities targeting specific components. Ongoing work in the Advanced Manufacturing and Mechanical Reliability Center at Case Western Reserve University is focusing on fracture and fatigue testing to rapidly assess critical mechanical properties of some titanium alloys before and after post-processing, in addition to conducting nondestructive testing/evaluation using micro-computerized tomography at General Electric. Process mapping studies are being conducted at Carnegie Mellon University while large area microstructure characterization and informatics (EBSD and BSE) analyses are being conducted at Materials Resources LLC to enable future integration of these efforts via an Integrated Computational Materials Engineering approach to AM. Possible future pathways for materials qualification are provided.},

Functionalization of the ABS framework was then performed by coating of porous Cu-BTC (BTC = benzene tricarboxylic acid) metal-organic frameworks on it using a step-by-step in-situ growth. The size of the Cu-BTC particles on ABS was ranged from 200 nm to 900 nm. The Cu-BTC/ABS framework can take up most of the space of the tubular reactor that makes the adsorption effective with no need of stirring. Methylene blue (MB) can be readily removed from aqueous solution by this Cu-BTC/ABS framework. The MB removal efficiency for solutions with concentrations of 10 and 5 mg/L was 93.3{\%} and 98.3{\%}, respectively, within 10 min. After MB adsorption, the Cu-BTC/ABS composite can easily be recovered without the need for centrifugation or filtration and the composite is reusable. In addition the ABS framework can be recovered for subsequent reuse. A significant advantage of 3D-printed frameworks is that different frameworks can be easily fabricated to meet the needs of different applications. This is a promising strategy to synthesize new frameworks using MOFs and polymers to develop materials for applications beyond adsorption.},

abstract = {In plastics industry it is a common practice to mechanically recycle waste material arising from production. However, while plastics are mechanically recycled, their mechanical properties change. These changes may affect material processing conditions and quality of the end products; therefore they need to be quantified. In this study, mechanical recycling of high density polyethylene (HDPE) was simulated by one-hundred (100) consecutive extrusions cycles. During extrusion, processability of virgin HDPE and its recyclates was studied by recording the processing conditions, i.e. melt pressure and extrusion torque, while after preparation of the recyclates, melt flow index measurements (MFI), small amplitude oscillatory shear tests (rheological properties), and differential scanning calorimetry measurements (DSC) of thermal properties were performed. Also, mechanical properties in solid state were characterized in terms of hardness and modulus measured by nanoindentation, and finally, shear creep compliance was measured to characterize the materials' time-dependent mechanical properties and its durability in solid state. In addition, gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and solubility tests were implemented to study changes in the material structure. The results on rheological and MFI measurements indicate significant structural changes in the material that occurred during the first 30 extrusion cycles. Those changes affect material processability which is as well supported by the recorded processing pressure and torque. On the other hand, processing did not significantly affect material thermal properties. Results on hardness and modulus show deterioration of the material mechanical properties after 10th reprocessing cycle. Similarly, shear creep compliance measurements showed an unfavourable effect of mechanical recycling on the time-dependent mechanical properties, particularly after the 30th extrusion cycle. In addition, results suggested chain branching as a dominating mechanism through first 30 extrusion cycles, domination of chain scission afterwards and also presence of cross-linking after 60th extrusion cycle.},

The paper discusses the evolution of Rapid Prototyping (RP) to Rapid Manufacturing and the current issues that require further research for the successful integration of this technology within manufacturing companies. The use of RM will have particular impact on supply chain management paradigms such as lean and agile and has particular strategic fit with mass customisation. The effect RM will have on these paradigms is discussed and confirmed with example cases from automotive production, motor sport and medical devices industries. In conclusion RM has already been shown in the three cases to offer benefits, particularly where fast re-configuration of the manufacturing process is required and with the production of customised components.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing technologies, such as selective laser melting of polymers enable manufacturing of complex parts without tools and forms. Due to high temperature during processing, a degradation of the used plastic powder occurs. The unmolded material in the building chamber, the so-called partcake, can be removed from the finished component after building and reused for another process. To realize reproducible part properties refreshing of partcake powder is necessary. This paper presents results on the investigations of degradation behavior of polyamide 12 powder during selective laser melting process. The influence of different ambient conditions, e.g. ambient air, nitrogen and vacuum, is investigated in a model experiment. Oven aged polymer powders were analyzed with regard to their process relevant material properties. Considered material properties are phase transition temperatures, melting viscosity or molecular weight. The results of the investigations show, that the influence of high process temperatures on used material can be reduced using other ambient conditions. Process relevant material properties are minor affected by storage under vacuum. In addition to that the influence of different ambient conditions as well as a material pretreatment on the degradation behavior of sls materials, e.g. exclusion of intermolecular located oxygen, is analyzed. To correlate these results of the model experiment with real manufacturing process laser sintering experiments are done. PA12 powder is used for several building processes with refreshing. Produced specimens and resulting partcake powder are analyzed and correlated to the results of model experiment. Correlating effects, regarding process relevant material properties as well as aging influenced mechanical properties of specimens can be detected.},

abstract = {Given the attention around additive manufacturing (AM), organizations want to know if their products should be fabricated using AM. To facilitate product development decisions, a reference system is shown describing the key attributes of a product from a manufacturability stand- point: complexity, customization, and production volume. Complexity and customization scales enable the grouping of products into regions of the map with common levels of the three attributes. A geometric complexity factor developed for cast parts is modified for a more general application. Parts with varying geometric complexity are then analyzed and mapped into regions of the complexity, customization, and production volume model. A discrete set of customization levels are also introduced. Implications for product development and manufacturing business approaches are discussed},

abstract = {This paper examines the differences between online synchronous and offline face-to-face collaboration in the context of a computer-supported modeling task. A mathematical problem was designed and set to the participants to solve. Their modeling process using ModellingSpace, a collaborative computer-supported educational environment, was monitored. 16 ninth grade students participated in the study, all worked in groups of two. Eight groups worked online, the remaining 8 offline. The analysis focused on the identification of students' cognitive modeling strategies, their interactions and the learning gain for each type of collaboration. Both qualitative and quantitative approaches were adopted as well as two complementary coding schemes to better investigate the peers' interactions. The results obtained suggest that pairs who worked online emphasized analysis and synthesis; they also demonstrated a higher learning gain. Offline pairs needed the teacher's support and demonstrated stronger social interaction. Moreover, although the actions of offline dyads were more numerous, the dyads that worked online seemed to present more task-oriented actions. Participants in both groups mutually explored the problem, with few disagreements among them. Our findings could inform the design of learning programs and the facilitation of collaborative tasks.},

abstract = {Purpose – By comparing two small high-tech firms specialising in medical technology this article seeks to answer the following questions: What are the key characteristics of innovation processes in the case firms? How do the mutual relationships between mental, social and physical spaces explain the different pathways in the innovation processes in the firms? Design/methodology/approach – One case is based on an in-depth study conducted by the authors. Regarding the other case, a secondary analysis is conducted of a case described in the literature. Both cases apply several data sources. The case firms are comparable in their most crucial aspects (field, main product, geographical location, joint learning space in the start-up phase). Findings – The firms have many similar features. The study, however, draws attention to the factors that have made them substantially different as contexts of innovation activities. The differences are interpreted through the concepts of physical, social and mental space. Special attention is paid to the tightness/permeability of boundaries circumscribing spaces and to how this condition supports/inhibits cooperation between different occupational groups in the product planning process. Tightness of boundaries is not unambiguously a good or a bad thing but permeable boundaries are needed when a mix of different knowledge bases is vital. Research limitations/implications – The focus remains within the firms. Innovation activities extend also beyond the borders of the organisation. Practical implications – Management should be aware of the productive and counterproductive effects of spaces and the means to influence their shaping. Originality/value – The study highlights the potential of the concept of space in an empirical comparative setting for studying organisational prerequisites for innovation processes and related learning and cooperation.},

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to critically review the literature related to dimensional accuracy and surface roughness for fused deposition modeling and similar extrusion-based additive manufacturing or rapid prototyping processes. Design/methodology/approach – A systematic review of the literature was carried out by focusing on the relationship between process and product design parameters and the dimensional and surface properties of finished parts. Methods for evaluating these performance parameters are also reviewed. Findings – Fused deposition modeling{\textregistered} and related processes are the most widely used polymer rapid prototyping processes. For many applications, resolution, dimensional accuracy and surface roughness are among the most important properties in final parts. The influence of feedstock properties and system design on dimensional accuracy and resolution is reviewed. Thermal warping and shrinkage are often major sources of dimensional error in finished parts. This phenomenon is explor...},

abstract = {Objectives Additive manufacturing, which is more colloquially referred to as 3D printing, is quickly approaching mainstream adoption as a highly flexible processing technique that can be applied to plastic, metal, ceramic, concrete and other building materials. However, taking advantage of the tremendous versatility associated with in situ photopolymerization as well as the ability to select from a variety of preformed processible polymers, 3D printing predominantly targets the production of polymeric parts and models. The goal of this review is to connect the various additive manufacturing techniques with the monomeric and polymeric materials they use while highlighting emerging material-based developments. Methods Modern additive manufacturing technology was introduced approximately three decades ago but this review compiles recent peer-reviewed literature reports to demonstrate the evolution underway with respect to the various building techniques that differ significantly in approach as well as the new variations in polymer-based materials being employed. Results Recent growth of 3D printing has been dramatic and the ability of the various platform technologies to expand from rapid production prototypic models to the greater volume of readily customizable production of working parts is critical for continued high growth rates. This transition to working part production is highly dependent on adapting materials that deliver not only the requisite design accuracy but also the physical and mechanical properties necessary for the application. Significance With the weighty distinction of being called the next industrial revolution, 3D printing technologies is already altering many industrial and academic operations including changing models for future healthcare delivery in medicine and dentistry.},

abstract = {Plastic lumber manufactured using post consumer waste plastic has been proposed as an acceptable material for use in the construction of docks, piers and bulkheads and is touted to outlast conventional wood products due to its strength, durability and resistance to rot. This study examines the long-term engineering properties of plastic lumber manufactured using post consumer waste plastic (TRIMAX, Ronkonkoma, NY). Plastic lumber profiles were used in the decking of a pier built in West Meadow Creek, Old Field, NY during December 1995. Samples of plastic lumber were removed from the deck of the pier periodically over a two-year period and returned to the laboratory for testing. Results of engineering tests showed the in-plane compression modulus (260??30 MPa), dimensional stability and the Shore D surface hardness (60??2) of plastic lumber removed from the pier remained similar to or greater than their pre-placement values. In contrast, significant changes in the modulus of elasticity of plastic lumber were measured with prolonged weathering. The modulus of elasticity of plastic lumber initially decreased from 1370 Pa to 750 Pa following 12 months weathering, a decrease equal to 45{\%} of its pre-placement value and then increased during the second year to close to its initial value. The high variability in the modulus of elasticity should restrict the use of plastic lumber profiles to non-load bearing structural applications. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Global awareness of material sustainability has increased the demand for bio-based polymers like poly(lactic acid) (PLA), which are seen as a desirable alternative to fossil-based polymers because they have less environmental impact. PLA is an aliphatic polyester, primarily produced by industrial polycondensation of lactic acid and/or ring-opening polymerization of lactide. Melt processing is the main technique used for mass production of PLA products for the medical, textile, plasticulture, and packaging industries. To fulfill additional desirable product properties and extend product use, PLA has been blended with other resins or compounded with different fillers such as fibers, and micro- and nanoparticles. This paper presents a review of the current status of PLA mass production, processing techniques and current applications, and also covers the methods to tailor PLA properties, the main PLA degradation reactions, PLA products' end-of-life scenarios and the environmental footprint of this unique polymer.},

While a lot of work has already been carried out as to what these technologies will bring in terms of product and process innovation, little has been done on their impact on business models and business model innovation. Yet, history has shown that technological revolution without adequate business model evolution is a pitfall for many businesses. In the case of 3D printing, the matter is further complicated by the fact that adoption of these technologies has occurred in four successive phases (rapid prototyping, rapid tooling, digital manufacturing, home fabrication) that correspond to a different level of involvement of 3D printing in the production process. This article investigates the effect of each phase on the key business model components. While the impact of rapid prototyping and rapid tooling is found to be limited in extent, direct manufacturing and, even more so, home fabrication have the potential to be highly disruptive. While much more value can be created, capturing value can become extremely challenging. Hence, finding a suitable business model is critical. To this respect, this article shows that 3D printing technologies have the potential to change the way business model innovation is carried out, by enabling adaptive business models and by bringing the 'rapid prototyping' paradigm to business model innovation itself.},

abstract = {This paper presents an integrated literature review on how the environmental sustainability of distributed production is studied in a variety of disciplinary sources. The notion of distributed production suggests an alternative to mass production that differs in scale, location and consumer-producer relationship. Understanding its environmental implications (and thereby dematerialization potential) is regarded pertinent and timely. Key themes in the review included how distributed production can promote product longevity and closed material loops, as well as localizing production. New and closer ties between producer and consumer seemed central discussions but were underdeveloped with regard to sustainability potential. Empirical work was seen especially in research on Additive Manufacturing Processes, while the bulk of the studies were conceptual explorations with little testing in the real world as yet. This affirms the emerging nature of the topic and points to a clear need for more (and more diverse) empirical research. The review summarizes the opportunities for greater environmental sustainability as well as potential threats that could serve to guide and improve these novel practices today. It sets the stage for 'distributed production' to be examined as its own phenomenon by proposing how it can be characterized and suggests that a research agenda could build upon the work initiated here.},

abstract = {Review: Recently the critical discussion about the preservation of natural resources and recycling has led to the renewed interest concerning biomaterials with the focus on renewable raw materials. Because of increasing environmental consciousness and demands of legislative authorities, use and removal of traditional composite structures, usually made of glass, carbon or aramid fibers being reinforced with epoxy, unsaturated polyester, or phenolics, are considered critically. Recent advances in natural fiber development, genetic engineering and composite science offer significant opportunities for improved materials from renewable resources with enhanced support for global sustainability. The important feature of composite materials is that they can be designed and tailored to meet different requirements. Since natural fibers are cheap and biodegradable, the biodegradable composites from biofibers and biodegradable polymers will render a contribution in the 21st century due to serious environmental problem. Biodegradable polymers have offered scientists a possible solution to waste-disposal problems associated with traditional petroleum-derived plastics. For scientists the real challenge lies in finding applications which would consume sufficiently large quantities of these materials to lead price reduction, allowing biodegradable polymers to compete economically in the market. Today's much better performance of traditional plastics are the outcome of continued R{\&}D efforts of last several years; however the existing biodegradable polymers came to public only few years back. Prices of biodegradable polymers can be reduced on mass scale production; and such mass scale production will be feasible through constant R{\&}D efforts of scientists to improve the performance of biodegradable plastics. Manufacture of biodegradable composites from such biodegradable plastics will enhance the demand of such materials. The structural aspects and properties of several biofibers and biodegradable polymers, recent developments of different biodegradable polymers and biocomposites are discussed in this review article. Collaborative R{\&}D efforts among material scientists and engineers as well as intensive co-operation and co-ordination among industries, research institutions and government are essential to find various commercial applications of biocomposites even beyond to our imagination.},

abstract = {This article explains the history, from 1600 BC to 2008, of materials that are today termed 'plastics'. It includes production volumes and current consumption patterns of five main commodity plastics: polypropylene, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene and polyethylene terephthalate. The use of additives to modify the properties of these plastics and any associated safety, in use, issues for the resulting polymeric materials are described. A comparison is made with the thermal and barrier properties of other materials to demonstrate the versatility of plastics. Societal benefits for health, safety, energy saving and material conservation are described, and the particular advantages of plastics in society are outlined. Concerns relating to littering and trends in recycling of plastics are also described. Finally, we give predictions for some of the potential applications of plastic over the next 20 years.},

@article{Anzalone2013,
abstract = {Although the environmental benefits of recycling plastics are well established and most geographic locations within the U.S. offer some plastic recycling, recycling rates are often low. Low recycling rates are often observed in conventional centralized recycling plants due to the challenge of collection and transportation for high-volume low-weight polymers. The recycling rates decline further when low population density, rural and relatively isolated communities are investigated because of the distance to recycling centers makes recycling difficult and both economically and energetically inefficient. The recent development of a class of open source hardware tools (e.g. RecycleBots) able to convert post-consumer plastic waste to polymer filament for 3-D printing offer a means to increase recycling rates by enabling distributed recycling. In addition, to reducing the amount of plastic disposed of in landfills, distributed recycling may also provide low-income families a means to supplement their income with domestic production of small plastic goods. This study investigates the environmental impacts of polymer recycling. A life-cycle analysis (LCA) for centralized plastic recycling is compared to the implementation of distributed recycling in rural areas. Environmental impact of both recycling scenarios is quantified in terms of energy use per unit mass of recycled plastic. A sensitivity analysis is used to determine the environmental impacts of both systems as a function of distance to recycling centers. The results of this LCA study indicate that distributed recycling of HDPE for rural regions is energetically favorable to either using virgin resin or conventional recycling processes. This study indicates that the technical progress in solar photovoltaic devices, open-source 3-D printing and polymer filament extrusion have made distributed polymer recycling and upcycling technically viable.},

While there is a large amount of research on organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), interorganizational citizenship behavior (ICB) has received less attention. This study examines a dense, localized cluster of private, public, and non-profit organizations. Seven dimensions characterize ICB during the different phases of the innovation process. These ICBs reflect 16 interorganizational practices that generate absorptive capacity. Seven of these practices occur during the ideation phase, five during the invention phase, and four during the exploitation phase. Cooperation and collaboration precede or underlie ICB. This study shows that spatial proximity is insufficient for enhancing innovation activities in industrial agglomerations and that ICB, collaboration, and cooperation are necessary. Therefore, these findings contribute to knowledge on the theory of innovation management and economic geography.},

The processability of pc-ABS blends was not substantially different by that of virgin ABS up to two recycling steps even if the third one induced a slightly decrease of viscosity, more remarkable on increasing the pc-ABS content.

abstract = {Decision on end-of-life product recovery options is affected by many factors; they are factors related to engineering, business, environmental, and societal factors. These factors come from wide spectrum of stakeholders' interests. Perspectives vary from one stakeholder to another; hence, some of these factors are conflicting. For example, product designers' interest in composite light weight material may conflict with recycler's interest in pure and easy-to-recycle material. A method that identifies all stakeholders who are directly involved or indirectly affected by such decision would be beneficial to the selection of right product recovery option. This paper provides a method that guides the process of decision making on end-of-life product recovery option. The method is different from previous ones in its inclusion of all stakeholders who has interest in the process. The proposed method gives decision maker flexibility to accommodate for different cases (Case specific situations). It is enough comprehensive to be general and enough flexible to be specific, this would make the decision taken using this method accurate by selecting appropriate recovery options, and informative by presenting the most influential factors that lead to the decision. Previous methods found in literature are reviewed and been inconsideration when developing the proposed method. Knowledge obtained from industrial best practices and well documented case studies also included. Product designers and business decision makers would benefit from this work on deciding about the fate of their product as a whole or its constituents. The implementation of the developed method is demonstrated through an industrial product; the method robustness is tested by assessing its sensitivity to extreme situations. In conclusion, the decision on end-of-life product recovery option is governed by different stakeholders. A method that considers the collective interests of all stakeholders is apparently needed; such method is developed in this paper and is validated using industrial example. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this article is to summarize the research done to date, to highlight successes in the field, and to identify opportunities that the union of AM and nanotechnology could bring to science and technology. Design/methodology/approach – Research in which metal, ceramic, and carbon nanomaterials have been incorporated into AM technologies such as stereolithography, laser sintering, fused filament fabrication, and three-dimensional printing is presented. The results of the addition of nanomaterials into these AM processes are reviewed. Findings – The addition of nanostructured materials into the printing media for additive manufacturing affects significantly the properties of the final parts. Challenges in the application of nanomaterials to additive manufacturing are nevertheless numerous. Research limitations/implications – Each of the AM methods described in this review has its own inherent limitations when nanoparticles are applied with the respective printing media. Overcoming these design boundaries may require the development of new instrumentation for successful AM with nanomaterials. Originality/value – This review shows that there are many opportunities in the marriage of AM and nanotechnology. Promising results have been published in the application of nanomaterials and AM, yet significant work remains to fully harness their inherent potential. This paper serves the purpose to researchers to explore new nanomaterials-based composites for additive manufacturing.},

abstract = {Polyethylene (PE) from postuse automotive fuel tanks is considered a valuable material for mechanical recycling, and we assessed its properties, paying particular attention to transport properties and processability. The characterization included the study of the sorption-desorption isotherms, the rheological analysis of the molten materials and their processability. In particular, we obtained, sorption-desorption isotherms using a model molecule (n-heptane) to simulate contact with the fuel. The measurements were carried out on films of PE blend for tanks and separately on the components of the blend. Rotational rheometry was carried out on scraps from used tanks and on virgin material for comparison. We performed some extrusion tests to evaluate the possibility of mechanical recycling of the postuse materials. In particular, we examined the melt-fracture incoming conditions by making use of a twin-screw extruder with a round die. Stress-strain measurements were carried out on films of virgin and used material, obtained with a press on a laboratory scale to evaluate the change of the mechanical properties of a manufacture obtained by reprocessing a polymer aged in contact with a mixture of liquids.},

abstract = {In addition to the steps taken to ensure optimal efficiency in industry, significant effort has been directed towards the green and sustainable manufacturing practices. In this paper, we review conventional and state-of-the-art manufacturing technologies to provide insight into energy consumption at the processing level. In the review, collected energy data were summarized for three manufacturing categories: conventional bulk-forming, subtractive, and additive manufacturing (AM) processes. Additive processes, in particular, are strongly emphasized in the Advanced Manufacturing Initiatives proposed recently by the United States government. Currently, the specific energy consumption (SEC) of additive processes is estimated to be ∼100-fold higher than that of conventional bulk-forming processes, with subtractive processes showing intermediate values that varied over a wide range in terms of scale. Although SEC may vary with respect to the details, in general, the research showed a negative correlation with respect to the reciprocal logarithmic form of the productivity. In addition to the literature review presented, we performed case studies for the three manufacturing processes, to provide practical examples of energy consumption. Additionally, our results indicated that AM processes may require more extensive evaluation; i.e.; an assessment of the entire manufacturing cycle, for more accurate prediction of the subsequent environmental impact. {\textcopyright} 2014 Korean Society for Precision Engineering.},

abstract = {Manufacturing in areas of the developing world that lack electricity severely restricts the technical sophistication of what is produced. More than a billion people with no access to electricity still have access to some imported higher-technologies; however, these often lack customization and often appropriateness for their community. Open source appropriate technology (OSAT) can over- come this challenge, but one of the key impediments to the more rapid development and distri- bution of OSAT is the lack of means of production beyond a specific technical complexity. This study designs and demonstrates the technical viability of two open-source mobile digital manufacturing facilities powered with solar photovoltaics, and capable of printing customizable OSAT in any com- munity with access to sunlight. The first, designed for community use, such as in schools or maker- spaces, is semi-mobile and capable of nearly continuous 3-D printing using RepRap technology, while also powering multiple computers. The second design, which can be completely packed into a standard suitcase, allows for specialist travel from community to community to provide the ability to custom manufacture OSAT as needed, anywhere. These designs not only bring the possibility of complex manufacturing and replacement part fabrication to isolated rural communities lacking access to the electric grid, but they also offer the opportunity to leap-frog the entire conventional manufacturing supply chain, while radically reducing both the cost and the environmental impact of products for developing communities},

Mass urbanisation can lead to social instability, undermining the capacity of cities to be environmentally sustainable and economically successful. A new model of sustainability is needed, including greater incentives to save energy, reduce consumption and protect the environment while also increasing levels of citizen wellbeing. Cities of the future should be a socially diverse environment where economic and social activities overlap and where communities are focused around neighbourhoods. They must be developed or adapted to enable their citizens to be socioeconomically creative and productive. Recent developments provide hope that such challenges can be tackled.

Living Labs have thus generated a great deal of interest in the field of ICT in the course of the last few years. However, the current body of Living Lab research literature indicates a lack of common understanding of how Living Labs can be used for ICT innovation and development. Moreover, there appears to be little agreement regarding needed future research. In order to establish a basis for future work on Living Labs, a review of the Living Lab literature related to ICT innovation and development has been carried out. Literature searches were made in four academic archives, as well as the ISI Web of Knowledge, Google and Google Scholar. Thirty-two relevant academic papers were retrieved. An overview of the literature was established and the literature was analyzed with regard to (1) common and diverging perspectives on Living Labs, (2) the state-of-the-art of Living Lab processes and methods, and (3) theoretical foundations of Living Labs. On the basis of the analyses, a common Living Lab definition is suggested. Two emerging Living Lab trends, as well as a pressing need for future research on Living Lab processes and methods, are introduced and discussed.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to ascertain the stab resistance characteristics of a series of planar and articulated laser sintered (LS) samples, in accordance with the United Kingdom Home Office Scientific Development Branch (HOSDB) Body Armour Standard - Publication 39/07. Design/methodology/approach - A series of LS planar samples were manufactured using an EOS P100 Formiga system, manufactured from 100 per cent virgin or a 50:50 mix of recycled and virgin Nylon (PA2200), ranging in thickness from 1-10 mm. All planar samples were stab tested to the HOSDB knife-resistance (KR) level one impact energy of 24 Joules, using an in-house manufactured HOSDB guided rail drop test impact rig and standardised knives. Penetration through the underside of each sample was measured and recorded. These results were then used to develop an articulated, additive manufactured (AM) scale textile - LS from a 50:50 mix of recycled and virgin PA2200 powder. These samples were then tested using the aforementioned impact rig and stab impact energy. Findings - The research demonstrated that while virgin PA2200 sample required a minimum thickness of 8mm to achieve stab-resistance below the HOSDB maximum penetration limit of 7 mm, this figure can be reduced to 5.6mm when manufacturing LS planar samples from a 50:50 mix of virgin and recycled PA2200. Results from stab testing the articulated samples indicated a successful AM textile-like design, with a maximum knife penetration of 1.6mm - below the 7mm HOSDB limit. Originality/value - The paper describes a unique application of AM technologies for the manufacture of high-performance stab resistant AM textiles. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

However, the lack of an open-source metal alternative and the high capital costs and slow throughput of proprietary commercialized metal 3-D printers has severely restricted their deployment. The applications of commercialized metal 3-D printers are limited to only rapid prototyping and expensive finished products. This severely restricts the access of the technology for small and medium enterprises, the developing world and for use in laboratories. This paper reports on the development of a {\textless}{\$}2000 open-source metal 3-D printer.

The present work focuses on the study of the melt flow behaviour (MFB) of Poly-epsilon-caprolactone (PCL) as a representative biomaterial, on the FDM. The MFB significantly affects the quality of the scaffold which depends not only on the pressure gradient, its velocity, and the temperature gradients but also physical properties like the melt temperature and rheology. The MFB is studied using two methods: mathematical modelling and finite element analysis (FEA) using Ansys(R). The MFB is studied using accurate channel geometry by varying filament velocity at the entry and by varying nozzle diameters and angles at the exit. The comparative results of both mathematical modelling and FEA suggest that the pressure drop and the velocities of the melt flow depend on the flow channel parameters. One inference of particular interest is the temperature gradient of the PCL melt, which shows that it liquefies within 35{\%} of the channel length. These results are invaluable to better understand the MFB of biomaterials that affects the quality of the scaffold built via FDM and can also be used to predict the MFB of other biomaterials.},

abstract = {We have studied the degradation resulting from reprocessing of post-consumer HDPE in order to verify its re-stabilization needs. Cone-plate rheometry was used to provide information about the molar mass and the molar mass distribution after reprocessing and stabilizing the material. Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), oxidation induction time (OIT), melt flow index (MFI) and cone-plate rheometry measurements were performed. Also, atomic absorption spectrophotometry tests were carried out to verify which catalytic residue was present in the recycled HDPE so as to correlate it to the degradation processes taking place in the polymer. The results showed that in this case the post-consumer HDPE displayed cross-linking when reprocessed, indicating the need for re-stabilization. They also showed that the use of 0.2{\%} antioxidant was efficient in blocking these processes, and that the cone-plate rheometry technique was powerful in assessing degradative processes. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

As doing so requires a thorough understanding of the level of user involvement in productive processes and a clear view of the nature of co-creative processes, this article provides a ‘prosumption' framework and a typology of co-creation activities. Then, based on case studies of 22 online 3D printing platforms, a service-based taxonomy of these platforms is constructed. The taxonomy and typology are then matched to investigate the role played by online 3D platforms in regard to the various types of co-creation activities and, consequently, how this impacts user innovation.},

@article{EllenMacArthurFoundation2015,
abstract = {The circular economy is gaining increasing attention in Europe and around the world as a potential way for our society to increase prosperity, while reducing dependence on primary materials and energy. The European Commission is expected to propose a “circular economy package” by the end of 2015, and many business leaders embrace the circular economy as a path to increasing growth and profitability. At the same time, a lively debate is going on about the attractiveness of a circular economy for different stakeholders and its implications for employment, growth, and the environment. This report aims to contribute to a fact base to inform this debate, especially in Europe. The report suggests what a circular European economy could look like and compares its potential impact with the current development path. The report models potential European economic and environmental outcomes in both scenarios. It also examines how a more circular way of satisfying human needs could play out in three of the largest and most resource-intensive European value chains: mobility, food, and the built environment. In aggregate, the circular scenarios suggest that the opportunity for Europe's economy could be large. The report does not aim to provide final answers or projections for a circular economy—this would be impossible given the major uncertainties involved in the transition. Rather, the report tries to identify and describe major differences that circularity could bring to the European economy and offers directional quantification of the most important differences. In doing so, the report builds on previous circular economy research, including work by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the McKinsey Center for Business and Environment. This report is the product of a knowledge partnership between the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Stiftungsfonds f{\"{u}}r Umwelt{\"{o}}konomie und Nachhaltigkeit (SUN),the new environmental economics branch of the Deutsche Post Foundation, and the McKinsey Center for Business and Environment. We encourage policy-makers inspired by the vision presented in this report to read the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's new and complementary report, Delivering the circular economy: A toolkit for policy-makers. The toolkit offers an actionable, step-by-step methodology to help transition towards a circular economy. We are grateful to our numerous partners and advisors for their insights and support throughout this project, as acknowledged in the pages that follow. This report has truly been a collaborative effort by business, policy-makers, and academia. We hope you find this report informative and useful. We invite you to engage with us on this timely opportunity.},

Two nanocomposite systems with different matrices i.e. PP-rich (75/25 composition) containing Cloisite 15A and PLA-rich (25/75 composition) containing Cloisite 30B were selected for investigation of effect of nanoclays and n-butyl acrylate glycidyl methacrylate ethylene terpolymers (PTW) as compatibilizer on mechanical properties of PP/PLA/clay nanocomposites. Tensile and impact properties of the nanocomposite systems were investigated and correlated with their microstructures. Tensile modulus and strength of the blends were increased while elongation at break decreased by increasing PLA content. There was an irregular relationship between impact strength of the blends and PLA content. Several proposed models for blends and nanocomposites were used for prediction of tensile modulus of the samples. Most of the proposed models for blends could predict the tensile modulus of the blends successfully at low content of PLA. Another notable point was that most of the micromechanical models for nanocomposites fitted well to experimental values at low content of the clays and showed deviations at high clay loadings.},

abstract = {The Selective Laser Sintering™ (SLS) process has proved to be an excellent method for prototyping functional parts out of engineering thermoplastics such as polyamides. However, the material undergoes physical and chemical changes due to repeated heating cycles in the SLS equipment. This causes variations in powder characteristics and performance in the SLS process. With the increased utilization of SLS for direct manufacturing it is necessary to develop a characterization and testing system that can determine powder fitness to ensure process stability and part quality. Current powder recycling methodologies use an average virgin-to-used powder mixture. In a new approach, a testing mechanism to deliver a numerical, measurable material characterization will be discussed. Experimental results of repeated reuse of material and its resulting physical effects on mechanical properties, shrinkage, and chemical tests will be presented. A definitive testing and measurement process control will be shown to improve process stability and thus part quality and consistency. Introduction},

abstract = {The use and consumption of polymeric resins is growing around the world because they are easily formed, and can be used in a variety of applications. The increasing consumption results in a great environmental impact because the used plastics are discarded in nature in a non-rational form. Facing all these problems, recycling becomes a powerful strategy regarding the reduction of the environmental impact caused by plastic waste. In this work polymeric blends were prepared by mechanical recycling and characterized. LDPE/Al residues from cartooned packaging were blended with recycled HDPE/LDPE and virgin PE resins. It was observed that processability, mechanical properties, chemical resistance and water absorption are dependent on the blend compositions. Also, an aluminum film was found to remain as isolated particles in the polymeric matrix and the mechanical behavior of the blend depends on the aluminum dispersion. Either, the blend water absorption depends on recycled material contamination, mainly polyamides. Finally, the amount of recycled material added to the blends determines both chemical stability and thermal characteristics. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Accelerated thermal and photo-aging of four homopolymers, low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP) and high-impact polystyrene (HIPS), was performed and the impact of subsequent reprocessing conditions on their properties studied. Polymer samples oven-aged at 100 ??C for varying periods of time or UV irradiated in a Weather-o-meter (WOM) at ?? = 340 nm were reprocessed in a Brabender plasticorder at 190 ??C/60 rpm for 10 min. Chemical changes and the evolution of rheological and mechanical properties accompanying the gradual degradation of the individual polymers were monitored and evaluated (DSC, FTIR, colorimetric method, MFI, tensile impact strength). LDPE and HIPS were found to be more susceptible to thermo-oxidation than HDPE and PP, whereas HDPE and PP were affected to a greater extent by UV exposure; the crucial role here is being played by the stabilization of the studied resins. In HDPE the scission and crosslinking reactions competed both in thermo-and photo-degradation. In the case of LDPE, scission prevailed over branching during thermo-oxidation, whereas photo-oxidation of the same sample led predominantly to crosslinking. Abrupt deterioration of the LDPE rheological properties after one week of thermal exposure was suppressed by re-stabilization. The scission reaction was also predominant for PP during thermo-oxidation, and it took place even faster during UV exposure. In the case of HIPS a slight photo-degradation of PS matrix is accompanied by simultaneous crosslinking of the polybutadiene component. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Pressureless reactive infiltration of such preforms at 1450°C in nitrogen atm. formed a SiC-Si composite with a coarse-SiC grain structure. Some residual carbon remained inside the SiC grains in this reaction bonded SiC-C due to sluggish reactivity of the larger carbon powder particles. Relatively complex-shaped carbon preforms with overhang, undercut, and inner channel structures were produced, demonstrating the capability of the 3DP process. A functionally graded SiC-Si composite was also fabricated, by varying carbon-yielding binder dosage during the preform fabrication, in order to control the spatial SiC concn. within the SiC-Si composite.

abstract = {Selective openness allows a firm to sell a systemic innovation that combines both open and proprietary technologies. Such firm strategies are now common for open source software and other information goods. However, they pose conceptual and practical uncertainties for hardware-focused companies, particularly as research on open hardware has emphasized community rather than firm success. Here we study firm openness in 3D printing, with a case study of how MakerBot Industries leveraged external communities and selective openness become the consumer market leader. After reviewing the literature on systemic innovation and selective openness, we document the proprietary strategies of a dozen startup companies during the first two decades of the 3D printing industry. We contrast this to the open hardware, software and content strategy that MakerBot's founders used to enter and grow the consumer market from 2009 onward. We show how MakerBot shifted to a selectively open, systemic innovation strategy that complemented proprietary hardware and software with open user-generated content from its Thingiverse online community. From this, we suggest the inherent complementarity of selective openness strategies between open and proprietary components, and conclude with predictions as to when and how a startup or incumbent firm will combine open and proprietary elements.},

abstract = {With the 26{\%} annual growth rate of additive manufacturing, especially
in the area of 3D polymer printing, the amount of waste is increasing at
a rapid rate. Limited research in the area of recycling has been
produced, yet there are several recycling machines being developed for
home use. Despite this work there is no published mechanical data on
components produced with filament recycled from 3D printed parts. There
is very limited data on mechanical properties of any 3D printed
materials. This article compares the properties of parts 3D printed with
virgin polylactic acid (PLA) to those printed with recycled PLA. Using
commercially available PLA and an entry level 3D printer, tensile and
shear specimens were produced and then tested for tensile yield
strength, modulus of elasticity, shear yield strength, and hardness. The
specimens were then ground up and re-extruded into filament, and a
second set of specimens were produced and tested using this recycled PLA
filament. Mechanical testing showed that 3D printing with recycled PLA
is a viable option. With the recycled filament, tensile strength
decreased 10.9{\%}, shear strength increased 6.8{\%}, and hardness decreased
2.4{\%}. The tensile modulus of elasticity was statistically unchanged.
Although the average mechanical properties before and after recycling
were similar, there was more variability in the results of the recycled
filament. Additionally, when printing with the recycled filament there
was some nozzle clogging, while none occurred with the virgin filament.
Overall, the mechanical properties of specimens 3D printed from recycled
PLA filament were similar to virgin properties, encouraging further
development in the area of recycling 3D printed filament.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V. Nowadays, the low recycling rate of polymers is still a challenge to humankind due to energy, economic and logistical issues. In the context of additive manufacturing, there is an exponential use of thermoplastic materials in the industrial and public open-source additive manufacturing sector, leading to an increase in global polymer consumption and waste generation. However, the coupling of the open-source 3D printers with polymer processing could potentially offer the basis for a new paradigm of distributed recycling process. It could be a complementary alternative to the traditional paradigm of centralized recycling of polymers, which is often uneconomical and energy intensive due to transportation embodied energy. In order to achieve this goal, a first step is to prove the technical feasibility to recycle thermoplastic material intended for open-source 3D printing feedstock. The contribution of the present study is twofold: first, a general methodology to evaluate the recyclability of thermoplastics used as feedstock in open-source 3D printing machines is proposed. Then, the proposed methodology is applied to the recycling study of polylactic acid (PLA) material addressed to the fused filament fabrication (FFF) technique, which is currently the most widely used. The main results of this application contribute to the understanding of the influence of the material's physico-chemical degradation on its mechanical properties as well as its potential distributed recyclability.},

Our discussions bring a new insight into how essential food material properties behave during application of 3D printing techniques. We suggest that the rational design of 3D food constructs relies on three key factors: (1) printability, (2) applicability and (3) post-processing. Especial emphasis is devoted to how the advantages/limitations of 3D printing techniques affect the end-use properties of the printed food constructs.},

abstract = {The degradation of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) during thermal–mechanical processing was studied and the influence of processing conditions on degradation rate was determined by size exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle light scattering (SEC–MALS). A two-parameter model accounting for both chain scission and recombination processes was used to describe the experimentally observed molar mass distribution. The degradation and recombination rate constants were determined for undried and dried PLA. It was highlighted that the effect of processing temperature (in the 170–210 °C range), processing time (until 30 min) and shear rate (rotor speed varying from 0 to 150 rpm) on molar mass reduction can be relatively well simulated insofar as self-heating related to the mechanical energy conversion into heat was taken into account. The influence of melt processing on the thermal behaviour of PLA was also investigated using temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry (TMDSC). It was evidenced that the molar mass reduction affects the crystallizability of PLA. Cold crystallization temperature progressively decreases with decreasing molar mass and the metastable $\alpha$' phase is formed in place of the stable $\alpha$ phase. The $\alpha$′ phase can be partially converted into $\alpha$ form during melting giving rise to a double-melting peak. The two peaks can be separated using reversing and non-reversing signals confirming that recrystallization of the $\alpha$′ form occurs.},

abstract = {Plastics draw a paramount amount of fossil fuel reaching nearly 300 million tons annually and continue to enter every production sector of our lives (automotive, aerospace, packaging, building, toys, furniture, clothing, medical etc.). While different from polyolefin, Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC), along with many halogenated polymers, all belong to the same thermo-plastic group. Rigid plasticized PVC is commonly used in pipes, window framing, floor coverings, roofing sheets, and cables; thereby it is discarded at a high rate. Adopting an appropriate recycling pathway is of both an economic value and an environmental benefit. The high hydrogen chloride content and the concern of dioxins and furans emission deter its thermochemical conversion. Re-compounding, particularly, when it is generated at a substantial amount and at low variation in composition, is the ultimate recycling strategy. In this work, analysis of the composition of PVC waste stream from the cable industry is carried out. Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) was conducted to infer the moisture, volatile, and inorganic filler fractions and the extent of thermal stability. These data are important to design the proper re-compounding, extrusion and injection conditions for the postconsumer PVC. Standard tensile and dynamic stress samples were produced and subjected to successive aging, extrusion and molding. Thermal properties were insignificantly altered, whereas mechanical properties lost some but tolerable flexibility. The results suggesting that PVC cable polymer can be reutilized in a close sustainable manufacturing which warrants ecological and economic benefit.},

abstract = {The term additive manufacturing (AM) describes a collection of production techniques enabling the layer-by-layer manufacture of components using digital data and raw material as inputs. The AM technology variant most frequently used in the production of end use parts is laser sintering (LS). It has been suggested that efficient usage of the energy inputs is one of the advantages of the technology. This paper presents a comparative assessment of the electricity consumptions of two major polymeric LS platforms: the Sinterstation HiQ + HS from 3D Systems and the EOSINT P 390 from EOS GmbH. The energy inputs to a build consisting of two prosthetic parts were recorded during power-monitoring experiments conducted on both platforms. This paper injects clarity into the ongoing research on the AM energy consumption by applying a novel classification system; it is argued that the AM energy usage can be divided into the job-dependent, time-dependent, geometry-dependent, and Z-height-dependent energy consumption values. The recorded mean real power consumption conforms to the values that have been reported for similar platforms. The measured energy consumption rates are higher than reported elsewhere. It is also shown that the purely time-dependent energy consumption is the main energy drain. Furthermore, the presentation of results in the context of previous literature highlights the caveats attached to summary metrics of the AM input usage.},

abstract = {A simulation of the degradation of high-impact polystyrene (HIPS), occurring during service life and mechanical recycling, was performed by multiple processing and thermo-oxidative ageing. All samples were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), melt mass-flow rate (MFR) measurements, tensile testing and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Multiple processing and thermo-oxidative ageing clearly alter the oxidative stability and the elongation at break of the materials. These changes observed at a macroscopic scale have been related to chemical alterations in the structure of HIPS. The polybutadiene phase was demonstrated to be the initiation point of the degradative processes induced by processing, service life and mechanical recycling. Thermo-oxidative degradation affects more severely the degree of degradation of the material, so it may be deduced that the changes occurring during service life of HIPS are the part of the life cycle that mostly affects its further recycling possibilities and performance in second-market applications. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

An electrically conducting polystyrene composite was developed and used with commercially available polystyrene (HIPS) to manufacture electrodes suitable for electrochemical experiments. Electrodes were produced and evaluated for cyclic voltammetry of aqueous 1,1'-ferrocenedimethanol and differential pulse voltammetry detection of aqueous Pb2+ via anodic stripping. A polystyrene/CNF/graphite (80/10/10 wt{\%}) composite provides good conductivity and a stable electrochemical interface with well-defined active geometric surface area. The printed electrodes form a stable interface to the polystyrene shell, give good signal to background voltammetric responses, and are reusable after polishing. {\textcopyright} 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

This paper provides a methodology for applying an open-source approach to design and development of a colorimeter. A 3-D printable, open-source colorimeter utilizing only open-source hardware and software solutions and readily available discrete components is discussed and its performance compared to a commercial portable colorimeter. Performance is evaluated with commercial vials prepared for the closed reflux chemical oxygen demand (COD) method. This approach reduced the cost of reliable closed reflux COD by two orders of magnitude making it an economic alternative for the vast majority of potential users. The open-source colorimeter demonstrated good reproducibility and serves as a platform for further development and derivation of the design for other, similar purposes such as nephelometry. This approach promises unprecedented access to sophisticated instrumentation based on low-cost sensors by those most in need of it, under-developed and developing world laboratories.},

Conclusion:
Reduction of cost of realiable closed reflux COD by two orders of magnitude making it an economic alternative for the vast majority of potential users.
The outlook for development of scientific-grade instrumentation utiliwing the FOSS appraoach is extremely promising. Inexpensive open source 3D printers and free software have put one-off production of highly specialized tools within the grasp of the end user, bypassing historically expensive design and manufacturing steps.

This methodology eliminates cost as a barrier to adoption and makes the tools available to the broadest possible audience.

As part of the operationalization process of the framework, a preliminary maturity grid is built and from there a questionnaire is designed. Afterwards, an international study with answers from ten laboratories from five different countries is done.

An attractive, but unexplored, application is to use a 3D printer to initiate chemical reactions by printing the reagents directly into a 3D reactionware matrix, and so put reactionware design, construction and operation under digital control. Here, using a low-cost 3D printer and open-source design software we produced reactionware for organic and inorganic synthesis, which included printed-in catalysts and other architectures with printed-in components for electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis. This enabled reactions to be monitored in situ so that different reactionware architectures could be screened for their efficacy for a given process, with a digital feedback mechanism for device optimization. Furthermore, solely by modifying reactionware architecture, reaction outcomes can be altered. Taken together, this approach constitutes a relatively cheap, automated and reconfigurable chemical discovery platform that makes techniques from chemical engineering accessible to typical synthetic laboratories.},

abstract = {Three Dimensional Printing is a process for creating parts directly from a computer model. 3D Printing builds parts in layers by spreading a layer of powder and then selectively joining the powder in the layer by ink-jet printing of a binder material. After all layers are printed, the layer loose of powder is removed to reveal the finished part. Application areas include ceramic molds for metal castings, directly printed parts for end-use and for use as tooling, ceramic preforms for metal matrix composites, structural ceramic parts, and others. 3D Printing is a member of a group of layer manufacturing techniques which have the primary distinguishing feature of creating parts by the controlled addition (rather than subtraction) of material. The primitive building element in 3D Printing is a spherical ensemble of powder particles held together by one droplet of binder. Ballistic effects are important in the formation of primitives due to kinetic energy associated with the incoming droplet. Stitching together of droplets forms surfaces and hence determines surface finish. Vertical dimensional control is determined in pan by the compression of powder layers by subsequently applied powder. These physical mechanisms help to determine the dimensional control and surface finish of 3D Printed parts. ?? 1993 CIRP.},

abstract = {Although additive layer manufacturing is well established for rapid prototyping the low throughput and historic costs have prevented mass-scale adoption. The recent development of the RepRap, an open source self-replicating rapid prototyper, has made low-cost 3-D printers readily available to the public at reasonable prices ({\textless}{\$}1,000). The RepRap (Prusa Mendell variant) currently prints 3-D objects in a 200x200x140 square millimeters build envelope from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA). ABS and PLA are both thermoplastics that can be injection-molded, each with their own benefits, as ABS is rigid and durable, while PLA is plant-based and can be recycled and composted. The melting temperature of ABS and PLA enable use in low-cost 3-D printers, as these temperature are low enough to use in melt extrusion in the home, while high enough for prints to retain their shape at average use temperatures. Using 3-D printers to manufacture provides the ability to both change the fill composition by printing voids and fabricate shapes that are impossible to make using tradition methods like injection molding. This allows more complicated shapes to be created while using less material, which could reduce environmental impact. As the open source 3-D printers continue to evolve and improve in both cost and performance, the potential for economically-viable distributed manufacturing of products increases. Thus, products and components could be customized and printed on-site by individual consumers as needed, reversing the historical trend towards centrally mass-manufactured and shipped products. Distributed manufacturing reduces embodied transportation energy from the distribution of conventional centralized manufacturing, but questions remain concerning the potential for increases in the overall embodied energy of the manufacturing due to reduction in scale. In order to quantify the environmental impact of distributed manufacturing using 3-D printers, a life cycle analysis was performed on a plastic juicer. The energy consumed and emissions produced from conventional large-scale production overseas are compared to experimental measurements on a RepRap producing identical products with ABS and PLA. The results of this LCA are discussed in relation to the environmental impact of distributed manufacturing with 3-D printers and polymer selection for 3-D printing to reduce this impact. The results of this study show that distributed manufacturing uses less energy than conventional manufacturing due to the RepRap's unique ability to reduce fill composition. Distributed manufacturing also has less emissions than conventional manufacturing when using PLA and when using ABS with solar photovoltaic power. The results of this study indicate that open- source additive layer distributed manufacturing is both technically viable and beneficial from an ecological perspective.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the polyamide 12 (PA12) powder properties deterioration in the laser sintering (LS) process and propose a methodology for more efficient powder recycling. The main goals are: to recommend a level of input PA2200 powder properties which could guarantee acceptable part quality in the LS process; and selection of the refresh rate in order to minimise the consumption of fresh material. Design/methodology/approach - The paper analyses the LS processing conditions and current recycling practices in relation to the deterioration or ageing of the PA12-based powders. Samples of new and recycled grades of PA2200 powder were artificially aged in a temperature-controlled oven and then tested using melt flow rate (MFR) indexer. Also, un-sintered powder samples collected from different locations within various builds, and different LS machines (EOSINT P700 and SinterstationUP/UP 2500 HiQ) were tested. Findings - The powder exposed at higher temperature and longer time experiences a much higher deterioration rate. The temperature and the time at which the un-sintered material was exposed are the most influential parameters for the powder aging. It was confirmed that the MFR index is a very sensitive indicator of the changes in the powder properties and provides a relatively fast and inexpensive method of measuring the rate of the powder degradation because of the LS process. The powder located in the periphery and the top of a build has a higher MFR and therefore is less deteriorated. In contrast, powder located in the centre, or in the bottom of a long build has much lower MFR and therefore is less usable. Practical implications - Based on the findings, a methodology for powder recycling is proposed. It allows a better control of the input material properties, a consistent quality of the fabricated parts, and more efficient use of the LS material. Originality/value - The paper provides some useful information for the properties deterioration of PA12-based powders (PA2200) in relation to the temperature and time at which the material is exposed in the LS. {\textcopyright} 2009 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {3D printing has received lots of attention due to its limitless potential and advantages in comparison to traditional manufacturing processes. This study focuses on the most popular type of home 3D printers, namely fused filament fabrication (FFF) printers, which use plastic filaments as the feedstock. The rather high material cost and large amount of plastic waste generated by FFF 3D printers have driven the need for plastic filaments produced from recycled plastic waste. This study evaluates, in terms of physical characterization, the feasibility of using recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE), one of the most commonly used plastics, as the feedstock for 3D printers, in comparison with the common acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic pellets. In-house extrusion using recycled HDPE pellets and flakes is possible. The diameter consistency and extrusion rate results, along with other physical characterization results, including differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and water absorption, suggest that making filaments from recycled HDPE pellets is a viable option, as the obtained filament has favorable water rejection and comparable extrusion rate and thermal stability. Existing methods for overcoming the warping and adhesion problems in 3D printing with HDPE were also reviewed. In order to increase the market competitiveness of waste-derived filaments, optimization of the extrusion process, studies on the mechanical and aging properties, and development of a standard characterization methodology and database are crucial.},

abstract = {Plastic recycling is a legal requirement and can yield environmental benefits. In the Netherlands, there is a complex network of various collection methods, separation centers, sorting centers and reprocessors. The first step of the recycling system, separating plastics from other waste, can occur within households (source-separation) or in separation centers (post-separation), making a difference in collection channel choice and technology requirements. The purpose of this paper is to provide decision support on choosing the most suitable combination of separation methods in the Netherlands. Decision support is given through optimized reverse logistics network design which makes the overall recycling system more efficient and sustainable, while taking into account the interests of various stakeholders (municipalities, households, etc.). A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, which minimizes both transportation cost and environmental impact, is used in this network design. The research follows the approach of scenario study; the baseline scenario is the current situation and other scenarios are designed with various strategic alternatives. Modeling is conducted by using a graphical optimi- zation tool IBM LogicNet Plus 7.1. Comparing these scenarios, the results show that the current network settings of the baseline situation is efficient in logistics terms but has a potential to adapt to strategic changes, depending on the assumptions regarding availability of the required processing facilities to treat plastic waste. In some of the tested scenarios, a separate collection channel for Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) bottles is cost efficient and saves carbon emission. Although the figures differ depending on the separation method choices of municipalities, our modeling result of all the tested scenarios shows a saving of more than 25 {\%} carbon emission compared to the current network.},

The scan of the healthy ear, the virtual superimposition of its mirrored image on to the defective side, and the rapid manufacturing of the substructure and of the mould eliminate several steps of traditional procedures (wax, stone, try-in). Moreover, the precise design and customization of the substructure is presented, with the original and engineered shape for the retention of the silicone. The time and cost saving results of this protocol are presented together with a discussion of the main design features that make the prosthesis a stable and reproducible system to improve rehabilitation of patients with auricular defects or absence.},

Drawing on an Economic and Social Research Council funded project, the paper details the results of research explor- ing possible futures of the manufacturing industry and impacts upon the transport of objects. Such ‘printing',or ‘personal fabrication', could permit many objects to be produced near to or even by consumers themselves on just-in-time ‘printing' machines. Widely known about in engineering and design, the impacts of these technologies on social practices and transport have yet to be much examined by social science. These technologies may become as ubiqui- tous as networked computers, with consequences just as significant. The paper reports on this recent research that seeks to understand some economic, social and environmental implications of what may be a major new socio-technical system currently in the making and which might have major consequences for the trajectory of the twenty-first century},

abstract = {Although the trend in manufacturing has been towards centralization to leverage economies of scale, the recent rapid technical development of open-source 3-D printers enables low-cost distributed bespoke production. This paper explores the potential advantages of a distributed manufacturing model of high-value products by investigating the application of 3-D printing to self-refraction eyeglasses. A series of parametric 3-D printable designs is developed, fabricated and tested to overcome limitations identified with mass-manufactured self-correcting eyeglasses designed for the developing world's poor. By utilizing 3-D printable self-adjustable glasses, communities not only gain access to far more diversity in product design, as the glasses can be customized for the individual, but 3-D printing also offers the potential for significant cost reductions. The results show that distributed manufacturing with open-source 3-D printing can empower developing world communities through the ability to print less expensive and customized self-adjusting eyeglasses. This offers the potential to displace both centrally manufactured conventional and self-adjusting glasses while completely eliminating the costs of the conventional optics correction experience, including those of highly-trained optometrists and ophthalmologists and their associated equipment. Although, this study only analyzed a single product, it is clear that other products would benefit from the same approach in isolated regions of the developing world.},

abstract = {Purpose: A low-cost, open source, self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) has been developed, which greatly expands the potential user base of rapid prototypers. The operating cost of the RepRap can be further reduced using waste polymers as feedstock. Centralized recycling of polymers is often uneconomic and energy intensive due to transportation embodied energy. This paper provides a proof of concept for high-value recycling of waste polymers at distributed creation sites. Approach: Previous designs of waste plastic extruders (also known as RecycleBots) were evaluated using a weighted evaluation matrix. An updated design was completed and the description and analysis of the design is presented including component summary, testing procedures, a basic life cycle analysis and extrusion results. The filament was tested for consistency of density and diameter while quantifying electricity consumption. Findings: Filament was successfully extruded at an average rate of 90 mm/min and used to print parts. The filament averaged 2.805mm diameter with 87{\%} of samples between 2.540mm and 3.081mm. The average mass was 0.564 g/100mm length. Energy use was 0.06 kWh/m. Originality: This paper reports on the first technical evaluation of a feedstock filament for the RepRap from waste plastic material made in a distributed recycling device. Practical Implications: The success of the RecycleBot further reduces RepRap operating costs, which enables distributed in-home, value added, plastic recycling. This has implications for municipal waste management programs as in-home recycling could reduce cost and greenhouse gas emissions associated with waste collection and transportation as well as the environmental impact of manufacturing custom plastic parts},

Here, we demonstrate a freeform fabrication system that prints with fully reusable physical voxels and minimal recycling effort. This new paradigm of digital (discrete) matter enables any number of materials to be printed together in any configuration. The individual voxels may then be reclaimed at will by dissolving the bonds holding the structure together. Coupled with a compatible voxel sorting process, we demonstrate multiple generations of freeform fabricated objects using the same physical material. This opens the door to a flexible desktop fabrication process in which 3D multi-material objects are fully recyclable and re-usable with minimal infrastructure.},

abstract = {In 1972, three scientists from MIT created a computer model that analyzed global resource consumption and production. Their results shocked the world and created stirring conversation about global 'overshoot,' or resource use beyond the carrying capacity of the planet. Now, preeminent environmental scientists Donnella Meadows, Jorgen Randers, and Dennis Meadows have teamed up again to update and expand their original findings in The Limits to Growth: The 30 Year Update. Meadows, Randers, and Meadows are international environmental leaders recognized for their groundbreaking research into early signs of wear on the planet. Citing climate change as the most tangible example of our current overshoot, the scientists now provide us with an updated scenario and a plan to reduce our needs to meet the carrying capacity of the planet. Over the past three decades, population growth and global warming have forged on with a striking semblance to the scenarios laid out by the World3 computer model in the original Limits to Growth. While Meadows, Randers, and Meadows do not make a practice of predicting future environmental degradation, they offer an analysis of present and future trends in resource use, and assess a variety of possible outcomes. In many ways, the message contained in Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update is a warning. Overshoot cannot be sustained without collapse. But, as the authors are careful to point out, there is reason to believe that humanity can still reverse some of its damage to Earth if it takes appropriate measures to reduce inefficiency and waste. Written in refreshingly accessible prose, Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update is a long anticipated revival of some of the original voices in the growing chorus of sustainability. Limits to Growth: The 30 Year Update is a work of stunning intelligence that will expose for humanity the hazy but critical line between human growth and human development.},

Closed-loop recycling of pure, well-defined wastes is a problem only in critical applications. The recycling of mixed wastes, on the other hand, gives rise to a number of technical and economic difficulties. Direct processing is difficult, because of the different melting behaviour and thermal stability of the various components, and moreover leads to polymer "alloys" with poor mechanical properties and marketing potential. Sorting processes still yield fractions of insufficient purity. Compatibilising additives are expensive and not very efficient. The future of recycling depends on the development of new markets for plastics with inferior properties and of processing methods to improve the properties of mixed plastics. Pyrolysis and hydrolysis open a range of interesting developments, but their economic and technical feasibility remain to be proven. Incineration, biodegradation and tipping cannot be considered to be fully satisfactory disposal methods, and recycling should be encouraged wherever it is economically and technically feasible. ?? 1977.},

abstract = {Facilitating start-ups located in the port-city interface is one of the current policy strategies of municipalities in many port-cities worldwide to encourage innovations in constantly evolving port areas. This could help the re-development of vacant ex-port land, while also offering new economic orientations for the city and the port. The aim of the paper is therefore to explore what conditions are needed to facilitate and encourage start-ups in innovation ecosystems in the port-city interface. The analysis is based on two in-depth case studies of the port-cities of Montreal (Canada) and Rotterdam (the Netherlands). The results indicate that government initiatives to actively facilitate start-ups in formerly industrialized port areas are quite successful. However, the functional linkages between start-ups and port activities remains rather limited, if not entirely absent, and the impact on the functioning of the innovation ecosystem at large is not substantial. Other factors such as capital, collaboration and proximity are valued more than the physical location of the start-up. In this, other actors in the ecosystem besides the municipality and the port authority also play a key role. Furthermore, start-ups often feel limited in their innovative capacity because of stringent regulations and institutional rigidness. Governments and port authorities could facilitate in this respect by working more demand-driven in terms of unburdening and creating more institutional support, instead of imposing top-down rules and regulations to try to govern the ecosystem, which in itself can be considered a contradiction in terms.},

Acknowledging the current context for waste management, the paper explores future interlinked questions which arise in the circular economy for responsible supply chains, additive manufacturing, and metals recycling. For example, where do mined and recycled resources fit in responsible supply chains as inputs to responsible production? What is required to ensure 3D production systems are resource efficient? How could more distributed models of production, enabled by additive manufacturing, change the geographical scale at which it is economic or desirable to close the loop? Examples are given to highlight the need for an integrated research agenda to address these questions and to foster Australian opportunities in the circular economy.},

abstract = {Plastic solid waste (PSW) presents challenges and opportunities to societies regardless of their sustainability awareness and technological advances. In this paper, recent progress in the recycling and recovery of PSW is reviewed. A special emphasis is paid on waste generated from polyolefinic sources, which makes up a great percentage of our daily single-life cycle plastic products. The four routes of PSW treatment are detailed and discussed covering primary (re-extrusion), secondary (mechanical), tertiary (chemical) and quaternary (energy recovery) schemes and technologies. Primary recycling, which involves the re-introduction of clean scrap of single polymer to the extrusion cycle in order to produce products of the similar material, is commonly applied in the processing line itself but rarely applied among recyclers, as recycling materials rarely possess the required quality. The various waste products, consisting of either end-of-life or production (scrap) waste, are the feedstock of secondary techniques, thereby generally reduced in size to a more desirable shape and form, such as pellets, flakes or powders, depending on the source, shape and usability. Tertiary treatment schemes have contributed greatly to the recycling status of PSW in recent years. Advanced thermo-chemical treatment methods cover a wide range of technologies and produce either fuels or petrochemical feedstock. Nowadays, non-catalytic thermal cracking (thermolysis) is receiving renewed attention, due to the fact of added value on a crude oil barrel and its very valuable yielded products. But a fact remains that advanced thermo-chemical recycling of PSW (namely polyolefins) still lacks the proper design and kinetic background to target certain desired products and/or chemicals. Energy recovery was found to be an attainable solution to PSW in general and municipal solid waste (MSW) in particular. The amount of energy produced in kilns and reactors applied in this route is sufficiently investigated up to the point of operation, but not in terms of integration with either petrochemical or converting plants. Although primary and secondary recycling schemes are well established and widely applied, it is concluded that many of the PSW tertiary and quaternary treatment schemes appear to be robust and worthy of additional investigation.},

abstract = {For the first time, low-cost open-source 3-D printing provides the potential for distributed manufacturing at the household scale of customized, high-value, and complex products. To explore the potential of this type of ultra-distributed manufacturing, which has been shown to reduce environmental impact compared to conventional manufacturing, this paper presents a case study of a 3-D printable parametric design for recreational vehicle (RV) solar photovoltaic (PV) racking systems. The design is a four-corner mounting device with the ability to customize the tilt angle and height of the standoff. This enables performance optimization of the PV system for a given latitude, which is variable as RVs are geographically mobile. The open-source 3-D printable designs are fabricated and analyzed for print time, print electricity consumption, mechanical properties, and economic costs. The preliminary results show distributed manufacturing of the case study product results in an order of magnitude reduction in economic cost for equivalent products. In addition, these cost savings are maintained while improving the functionality of the racking system. The additional electrical output for a case study RV PV system with improved tilt angle functionality in three representative locations in the U.S. was found to be on average over 20{\%} higher than that for conventional mass-manufactured racking systems. The preliminary results make it clear that distributed manufacturing -even at the household level -with open-source 3-D printers is technically viable and economically beneficial. Further research is needed to expand the results of this preliminary study to other types of products.},

abstract = {This study provides an in-depth investigation into low-cost and no-cost substrate release mechanisms that allow gas metal arc weld 3-D printed ER4043 aluminum and ER70S-6 steel parts to be removed from a reusable print substrate with minimal energy. Aluminum oxide, boron nitride, and titanium nitride coatings were evaluated as possible substrate release agents for aluminum printing. Additionally, the in situ formation of substrate release agents such as intermetallics and oxides were tested for both aluminum and steel printing. Testing was performed with a modified Charpy impact tester to remove 3-D printed metal parts from an 1100 aluminum or A36 low carbon steel print substrate to assess the impact energy required for removal. Specimen porosity was measured prior to sectioning and microstructural analysis, hardness traverses were measured across the specimens, and the elastic and shear moduli of the parts were analyzed via ultrasonic methods. All of the employed substrate release mechanisms minimized weld penetration and, in some instances, formed a brittle phase with the print substrate that allowed the specimens to be removed with minimal impact energy. These results thus provide methods with the removal of metal 3-D printed parts from print substrates with no specialized tooling or equipment conducive to distributed manufacturing.},

abstract = {The circular economy (CE) aims to radically improve resource efficiency by eliminating the concept of waste and leading to a shift away from the linear take-make-waste model. In a CE, resources are flowing in a circular manner either in a biocycle (biomass) or technocycle (inorganic materials). While early studies indicate that 3D printing (3DP) holds substantial promise for sustainability and the creation of a CE, there is no guarantee that it will do so. There is great uncertainty regarding whether the current trajectory of 3DP adoption is creating more circular material flows or if it is leading to an alternative scenario in which less eco-efficient localised production, demands for customised goods, and a higher rate of product obsolescence combine to bring about increased resource consumption. It is critical that CE principles are embedded into the new manufacturing system before the adoption of 3DP reaches a critical inflection point in which negative practices become entrenched. This paper, authored by both academic and industry experts, proposes a research agenda to determine enablers and barriers for 3DP to achieve a CE. We explore the two following overarching questions to discover what specific issues they entail: (1) How can a more distributed manufacturing system based on 3DP create a circular economy of closed-loop material flows? (2) What are the barriers to a circular 3D printing economy? We specifically examine six areas-design, supply chains, information flows, entrepreneurship, business models and education-with the aim of formulating a research agenda to enable 3DP to reach its full potential for a CE.},

These include polymer chemistry and physics, process engineering and manufacturing engineering. This paper presents a concise background of the current state of knowledge with respect to POSTC-PET recycling covering the disciplines mentioned above. In the first section of this paper, a brief background is presented about virgin PET synthesis, thermal transitions, processing and applications. The second section covers the PET recycling process with a focus on contamination and ways to increase the molecular weight of recycled PET (R-PET). It serves as an introduction to Section 3 where the chain extension process is described in detail. In Section 3, the current understanding of chain extenders, chain extension experimentation variables and equipment is reviewed. Reactive extrusion process is described in Section 4 with a special focus on system stability under chain extension conditions. Section 5 covers the effect of chain extension on R-PET thermal transitions and crystallinity. Section 6 presents the injection stretch blow moulding (ISBM) process as a possible application for R-PET with a focus on preform and bottle moulding. The last section gives a description of FT-IR technology to detect bottles' orientation and conformation changes. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved.},

abstract = {As-cast, porous surfaced CoCr implants were tested for bone interfacial shear strength in a canine transcortical model. Three-dimensional printing (3DP) was used to create complex molds with a dimensional resolution of 175 mum 3DP is a solid freeform fabrication technique that can generate ceramic pieces by printing binder onto a bed of ceramic powder. A printhead is rastered across the powder, building a monolithic mold, layer by layer. Using these 3DP molds, surfaces can be textured "as-cast," eliminating the need for additional processing as with commercially available sintered beads or wire mesh surfaces. Three experimental textures were fabricated, each consisting of a surface layer and deep layer with distinct individual porosities. The surface layer ranged from a porosity of 38{\%} (Surface Y) to 67{\%} (Surface Z), whereas the deep layer ranged from 39{\%} (Surface Z) to 63{\%} (Surface Y). An intermediate texture was fabricated that consisted of 43{\%} porosity in both surface and deep layers (Surface X). Control surfaces were commercial sintered beaded coatings with a nominal porosity of 37{\%}. A well-documented canine transcortical implant model was utilized to evaluate these experimental surfaces. In this model, five cylindrical implants were placed in transverse bicortical defects in each femur of purpose bred coon-hounds. A Latin Square technique was used to randomize the experimental implants left to right and proximal to distal within a given animal and among animals. Each experimental site was paired with a porous coated control site located at the same level in the contralateral limb. Thus, for each of the three time periods (6, 12, and 26 weeks) five dogs were utilized, yielding a total of 24 experimental sites and 24 matched pair control sites. At each time period, mechanical push-out tests were used to evaluate interfacial shear strength. Other specimens were subjected to histomorphometric analysis. Macrotexture Z, with the highest surface porosity, failed at a significantly higher shear stress (p = 0.05) than the porous coated controls at 26 weeks. It is postulated that an increased volume of ingrown bone, resulting from a combination of high surface porosity and a high percentage of ingrowth, was responsible for the observed improvement in strength. Macrotextures X and Y also had significantly greater bone ingrowth than the controls (p = 0.05 at 26 weeks), and displayed, on average, greater interfacial shear strengths than controls, although they were not statistically significant.

abstract = {Fabrication spaces (Fab-spaces) provide individuals with access to numerous manufacturing equipment (including additive manufacturing), to carry out different types of projects. Although scholars are starting to speculate about the importance of these new organisational forms and their potential for future distributed innovation and production ecologies, this phenomenon is still largely unexplored. Building on existing multidisciplinary research, this paper offers the first empirical analysis of existing fab-spaces as providers of knowledge and production competencies. Amongst all the possible perspectives to derive a framework, we choose that of fab-space users who have an entrepreneurial intention. After deriving an analytical framework to position fab-spaces in the current academic discourse, the paper develops a classification, which considers the competences available to entrepreneurs, via fab-spaces, in conjunction with how these competences are provided. The resulting map reveals the complementarities amongst the different fab-spaces. It also shows that the current portfolio of fab-spaces supports mainly the distribution of innovation across locations and social groups. Several types of fab-spaces are currently well placed to support the transition from innovation to manufacturing, but their geographical distribution and range of manufacturing capabilities are not yet enough to provide a fully distributed manufacturing model. This study has practical consequences for entrepreneurs, in the better identification of the appropriate fab-spaces for their needs, and for policy-makers, to help position the different types of fab-spaces as elements for national systems of innovation and production.},
